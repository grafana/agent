# Zipkin Receiver

This receiver receives spans from [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/) (V1 and V2).

To get started, all that is required to enable the Zipkin receiver is to
include it in the receiver definitions. This will enable the default values as
specified [here](./factory.go).
The following is an example:

```yaml
receivers:
  zipkin:
```

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented [here](./config.go)
with detailed sample configurations [here](./testdata/config.yaml).
