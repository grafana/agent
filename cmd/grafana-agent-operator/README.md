# Grafana Agent Operator

The Grafana Agent Operator is a Kubernetes operator that makes it easier to
deploy Grafana Agent and easier to discover targets for metric collection.

It is based on the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator)
and aims to be compatible the official ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, and Probe
CRDs that Prometheus Operator useres are used to.
