# Grafana Agent Operator

The Grafana Agent Operator is a Kubernetes operator that makes it easier to
deploy Grafana Agent and easier to discover targets for metric collection.

It is currently in **active development** and can't (and shouldn't!) be used in
production environments.

## Developer Reference

The [Developer's Guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md) includes basic information to help you
understand how the code works. This can be very useful if you are planning on
working on the Operator.
