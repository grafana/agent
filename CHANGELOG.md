Main (unreleased)
-----------------

### Features

- Added a new `stage.decolorize` stage to `loki.process` component which 
  allows to strip ANSI color codes from the log lines. (@thampiotr)

### Bugfixes

- Fixed an issue where `loki.process` validation for stage `metric.counter` was 
  allowing invalid combination of configuration options. (@thampiotr)

v0.37.1 (2023-10-10)
-----------------

### Bugfixes

- Fix the initialization of the default namespaces map for the operator and the
  loki.source.kubernetes component. (@wildum)

v0.37.0 (2023-10-10)
-----------------

### Breaking changes

- Set `retry_on_http_429` to `true` by default in the `queue_config` block in static mode's `remote_write`. (@wildum)

- Renamed `non_indexed_labels` Loki processing stage to `structured_metadata`. (@vlad-diachenko)

- Include `otel_scope_name` and `otel_scope_version` in all metrics for `otelcol.exporter.prometheus`
  by default using a new argument `include_scope_labels`. (@erikbaranowski)

- Static mode Windows Certificate Filter no longer restricted to TLS 1.2 and specific cipher suites. (@mattdurham)

- The `__meta_agent_integration*` and `__meta_agent_hostname` labels have been
  removed from the targets exposed by `prometheus.exporter.*` components and
  got replaced by the pair of `__meta_component_name` and `__meta_component_id`
  labels. (@tpaschalis)

- Flow: Allow `prometheus.exporter.unix` to be specified multiple times and used in modules. This now means all
  `prometheus.exporter.unix` references will need a label `prometheus.exporter.unix "example"`. (@mattdurham)

### Features

- New Grafana Agent Flow components:

  - `discovery.consulagent` discovers scrape targets from Consul Agent. (@wildum)
  - `discovery.dockerswarm` discovers scrape targets from Docker Swarm. (@wildum)
  - `discovery.ionos` discovers scrape targets from the IONOS Cloud API. (@wildum)

  In static mode it can be configured in the global `file_watch_config` via `min_poll_frequency` and `max_poll_frequency`.  (@wildum)

- Flow: In `prometheus.exporter.blackbox`, allow setting labels for individual targets. (@spartan0x117)

- Add optional `nil_to_zero` config flag for `YACE` which can be set in the `static`, `discovery`, or `metric` config blocks. (@berler)

- The `cri` stage in `loki.process` can now be configured to limit line size.

- Flow: Allow `grafana-agent run` to accept a path to a directory of `*.river` files.

  remote_write to free memory associated with removed series sooner. (@rfratto)

- Added a `disable_high_cardinality_metrics` configuration flag to `otelcol`
  exporters and receivers to switch high cardinality debug metrics off.  (@glindstedt)

- `loki.source.kafka` component now exposes internal label `__meta_kafka_offset`
  to indicate offset of consumed message. (@hainenber)

- Add a`tail_from_end` attribute in `loki.source.file` to have the option to start tailing a file from the end if a cached position is not found.
  This is valuable when you want to tail a large file without reading its entire content. (@wildum)

- Flow: improve river config validation step in `prometheus.scrape` by comparing `scrape_timeout` with `scrape_interval`. (@wildum)

- Flow: add `randomization_factor` and `multiplier` to retry settings in
  `otelcol` components. (@rfratto)

- Add support for `windows_certificate_filter` under http tls config block. (@mattdurham)

- Add `openstack` config converter to convert OpenStack yaml config (static mode) to river config (flow mode). (@wildum)

- Some `otelcol` components will now display their debug metrics via the
  Agent's `/metrics` endpoint. Those components include `otelcol.receiver.otlp`,
  `otelcol.exporter.otlp` and `otelcol.processor.batch`. There may also be metrics
  from other components which are not documented yet. (@ptodev)

- Agent Management: Honor 503 ServiceUnavailable `Retry-After` header. (@jcreixell)

- Bump opentelemetry-collector and opentelemetry-collector-contrib versions from v0.80 to v0.85 (@wildum):

  - add `authority` attribute to `otelcol.receiver.otlp` to override the default value in gRPC requests.
  - add `disable_keep_alives` attribute to `otelcol.receiver.otlp` to disable the HTTP keep alive feature.
  - add `traces_url_path`, `metrics_url_path` and `logs_url_path` attributes to `otelcol.receiver.otlp` to specify the URl path to respectively receive traces, metrics and logs on.
  - add the value `json` to the `encoding` attribute of `otelcol.receiver.kafka`. The component is now able to decode `json` payload and to insert it into the body of a log record.

- Added `scrape` block to customize the default behavior of `prometheus.operator.podmonitors`, `prometheus.operator.probes`, and `prometheus.operator.servicemonitors`. (@sberz)

- The `instance` label of targets exposed by `prometheus.exporter.*` components
  is now more representative of what is being monitored. (@tpaschalis)

- Promtail converter will now treat `global positions configuration is not supported` as a Warning instead of Error. (@erikbaranowski)

- Add new `agent_component_dependencies_wait_seconds` histogram metric and a dashboard panel
  that measures how long components wait to be evaluated after their dependency is updated (@thampiotr)

- Add additional endpoint to debug scrape configs generated inside `prometheus.operator.*` components (@captncraig)

- Components evaluation is now performed in parallel, reducing the impact of
  slow components potentially blocking the entire telemetry pipeline.
  The `agent_component_evaluation_seconds` metric now measures evaluation time
  of each node separately, instead of all the directly and indirectly
  dependant nodes. (@thampiotr)

- Update Prometheus dependency to v2.46.0. (@tpaschalis)

- The `client_secret` config argument in the `otelcol.auth.oauth2` component is 
  now of type `secret` instead of type `string`. (@ptodev)

### Bugfixes

- Fixed `otelcol.exporter.prometheus` label names for the `otel_scope_info`
  metric to match the OTLP Instrumentation Scope spec. `name` is now `otel_scope_name`
  and `version` is now `otel_version_name`. (@erikbaranowski)

- Fixed a bug where converting `YACE` cloudwatch config to river skipped converting static jobs. (@berler)

- Fixed the `agent_prometheus_scrape_targets_gauge` incorrectly reporting all discovered targets
  instead of targets that belong to current instance when clustering is enabled. (@thampiotr)

- Fixed race condition in cleaning up metrics when stopping to tail files in static mode. (@thampiotr)

- Fixed a bug where the BackOffLimit for the kubernetes tailer was always set to zero. (@anderssonw)

- Fixed a bug where Flow agent fails to load `comment` statement in `argument` block. (@hainenber)

v0.36.1 (2023-09-06)
--------------------

### Bugfixes

  changes or the last load failed. This was specifically impacting `module.git`
  each time it pulls. (@erikbaranowski)

- Allow overriding default `User-Agent` for `http.remote` component (@hainenber)

- Fix panic when running `grafana-agentctl config-check` against config files

  failed. This caused failed requests to initially export empty values, which
  could lead to propagating issues downstream to other components which expect
  the export to be non-empty. (@rfratto)

- Allow `bearerTokenFile` field to be used in ServiceMonitors. (@captncraig)

- Fix issue where metrics and traces were not recorded from components within modules. (@mattdurham)

- `service_name` label is inferred from discovery meta labels in `pyroscope.scrape` (@korniltsev)

v0.34.0 (2023-06-08)
--------------------

### Breaking changes

- The experimental dynamic configuration feature has been removed in favor of Flow mode. (@mattdurham)

- The `oracledb` integration configuration has removed a redundant field `metrics_scrape_interval`. Use the `scrape_interval` parameter of the integration if a custom scrape interval is required. (@schmikei)

- Upgrade the embedded windows_exporter to commit 79781c6. (@jkroepke)

- Prometheus exporters in Flow mode now set the `instance` label to a value similar to the one they used to have in Static mode (<hostname> by default, customized by some integrations). (@jcreixell)

- `phlare.scrape` and `phlare.write` have been renamed to `pyroscope.scrape` and `pyroscope.scrape`. (@korniltsev)

- Support in-memory HTTP traffic for Flow components. `prometheus.exporter`
  components will now export a target containing an internal HTTP address.
  `prometheus.scrape`, when given that internal HTTP address, will connect to
  the server in-memory, bypassing the network stack. Use the new
  `--server.http.memory-addr` flag to customize which address is used for
  in-memory traffic. (@rfratto)
- Disable node_exporter on Windows systems (@jkroepke)
- Operator support for OAuth 2.0 Client in LogsClientSpec (@DavidSpek)

- Use Go 1.20.4 for builds. (@tpaschalis)

- Integrate the new ExceptionContext which was recently added to the Faro Web-SDK in the
  app_agent_receiver Payload. (@codecapitano)

- Flow clustering: clusters will now use 512 tokens per node for distributing
  work, leading to better distribution. However, rolling out this change will
  cause some incorrerct or missing assignments until all nodes are updated. (@rfratto)

  would not take effect. (@thampiotr)

- Flow: Fix an issue within S3 Module where the S3 path was not parsed correctly when the
  path consists of a parent directory. (@jastisriradheshyam)

- Flow: Fix an issue on Windows where `prometheus.remote_write` failed to read
  WAL checkpoints. This issue led to memory leaks once the initial checkpoint
  was created, and prevented a fresh process from being able to deliver metrics
  at all. (@rfratto)

- Fix an issue where the `loki.source.kubernetes` component could lead to
  the Agent crashing due to a race condition. (@tpaschalis)

### Other changes

- The `phlare.scrape` Flow component `fetch profile failed` log has been set to

  goroutines to leak. (@rfratto)

### Other changes

- Support Bundles report the status of discovered log targets. (@tpaschalis)

v0.33.0 (2023-04-25)
--------------------

### Breaking changes

- Support for 32-bit ARM builds is removed for the foreseeable future due to Go
  compiler issues. We will consider bringing back 32-bit ARM support once our Go
  compiler issues are resolved and 32-bit ARM builds are stable. (@rfratto)

`agent_management.host`. The API path and version is now defined by the Agent. (@jcreixell)

- Agent Management: `agent_management.protocol` config field now allows defining "http" and "https" explicitly. Previously, "http" was previously used for both, with the actual protocol used inferred from the api url, which led to confusion. When upgrading, make sure to set to "https" when replacing `api_url` with `host`. (@jcreixell)

- Agent Management: `agent_management.remote_config_cache_location` config field has been replaced by
`agent_management.remote_configuration.cache_location`. (@jcreixell)

- Remove deprecated symbolic links to to `/bin/agent*` in Docker containers,
  as planned in v0.31. (@tpaschalis)

### Deprecations

  Whether an error was returned depended on the internal type of the value.
  (@rfratto)

- Flow: fix issue where using the `jaeger_remote` sampler for the `tracing`
  block would fail to parse the response from the remote sampler server if it
  used strings for the strategy type. This caused sampling to fall back
  to the default rate. (@rfratto)

- Flow: fix issue where components with no arguments like `loki.echo` were not
  viewable in the UI. (@rfratto)

- Flow: fix deadlock in `loki.source.file` where terminating tailers would hang
  while flushing remaining logs, preventing `loki.source.file` from being able
  to update. (@rfratto)

  remote-write defaults. (@erikbaranowski)

v0.32.1 (2023-03-06)
--------------------

### Bugfixes

- Flow: Fixes slow reloading of targets in `phlare.scrape` component. (@cyriltovena)

- Flow: add a maximum connection lifetime of one hour when tailing logs from
  `loki.source.kubernetes` and `loki.source.podlogs` to recover from an issue
  where the Kubernetes API server stops responding with logs without closing
  the TCP connection. (@rfratto)

- Flow: fix issue in `loki.source.kubernetes` where `__pod__uid__` meta label
  defaulted incorrectly to the container name, causing tailers to never
  restart. (@rfratto)

--------------------

### Breaking changes

- Support for the embedded Flow UI for 32-bit ARMv6 builds is temporarily
  removed. (@rfratto)

- Node Exporter configuration options changed to align with new upstream version (@Thor77):

  - `diskstats_ignored_devices` is now `diskstats_device_exclude` in agent configuration.
  - `ignored_devices` is now `device_exclude` in flow configuration.

- Some blocks in Flow components have been merged with their parent block to make the block hierarchy smaller:

  - `discovery.docker > http_client_config` is merged into the `discovery.docker` block. (@erikbaranowski)
  - `discovery.kubernetes > http_client_config` is merged into the `discovery.kubernetes` block. (@erikbaranowski)
  - `loki.source.kubernetes > client > http_client_config` is merged into the `client` block. (@erikbaranowski)
  - `loki.source.podlogs > client > http_client_config` is merged into the `client` block. (@erikbaranowski)
  - `loki.write > endpoint > http_client_config` is merged into the `endpoint` block. (@erikbaranowski)
  - `mimir.rules.kubernetes > http_client_config` is merged into the `mimir.rules.kubernetes` block. (@erikbaranowski)
  - `otelcol.receiver.opencensus > grpc` is merged into the `otelcol.receiver.opencensus` block. (@ptodev)
  - `otelcol.receiver.zipkin > http` is merged into the `otelcol.receiver.zipkin` block. (@ptodev)

  - `prometheus.scrape > http_client_config` is merged into the `prometheus.scrape` block. (@erikbaranowski)

- The `loki.process` component now uses a combined name for stages, simplifying
  the block hierarchy. For example, the `stage > json` block hierarchy is now a
  single block called `stage.json`. All stage blocks in `loki.process` have
  been updated to use this simplified hierarchy. (@tpaschalis)

- `remote.s3` `client_options` block has been renamed to `client`. (@mattdurham)

- Renamed `prometheus.integration.node_exporter` to `prometheus.exporter.unix`. (@jcreixell)

- As first announced in v0.30, support for the `EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_FLOW`

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a reconciliation error in Grafana Agent Operator when using `tlsConfig`
  on `Probe`. (@supergillis)

  starting line. (@rfratto)

- Flow: fix issues in `agent fmt` where adding an inline comment on the same
  line as a `[` or `{` would cause indentation issues on subsequent lines.
  (@rfratto)

- Flow: fix issues in `agent fmt` where line comments in arrays would be given
  the wrong identation level. (@rfratto)

- Flow: fix issues with `loki.file` and `loki.process` where deadlock contention or
  logs fail to process. (@mattdurham)

- Flow: `oauth2 > tls_config` was documented as a block but coded incorrectly as
  an attribute. This is now a block in code. This impacted `discovery.docker`,
  `discovery.kubernetes`, `loki.source.kubernetes`, `loki.write`,
  `mimir.rules.kubernetes`, `phlare.scrape`, `phlare.write`,
  `prometheus.remote_write`, `prometheus.scrape`, and `remote.http`
  (@erikbaranowski)

- Flow: Fix issue where using `river:",label"` causes the UI to return nothing. (@mattdurham)

### Other changes

- Use Go 1.20 for builds. (@rfratto)

- The beta label from Grafana Agent Flow has been removed. A subset of Flow
  components are still marked as beta or experimental:

  - `loki.echo` is explicitly marked as beta.
  - `loki.source.kubernetes` is explicitly marked as experimental.
  - `loki.source.podlogs` is explicitly marked as experimental.
  - `mimir.rules.kubernetes` is explicitly marked as beta.

### Bugfixes

- Flow: `prometheus.relabel` will no longer modify the labels of the original
  metrics, which could lead to the incorrect application of relabel rules on
  subsequent relabels. (@rfratto)

- Flow: `loki.source.file` will no longer deadlock other components if log
  lines cannot be sent to Loki. `loki.source.file` will wait for 5 seconds per

  (@rfratto)

- riverfmt: Allow function arguments to persist across different lines.
  (@rfratto)

- Flow: The HTTP server will now start before the Flow controller performs the
  initial load. This allows metrics and pprof data to be collected during the
  first load. (@rfratto)

- Add support for using a [password map file](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter/blob/master/contrib/sample-pwd-file.json) in `redis_exporter`. (@spartan0x117)

### Other changes

- Grafana Agent Flow has graduated from experimental to beta.

v0.29.0 (2022-11-08)
--------------------

> **BREAKING CHANGES**: This release has breaking changes. Please read entries
> carefully and consult the [upgrade guide][] for specific instructions.

### Breaking changes

- JSON-encoded traces from OTLP versions earlier than 0.16.0 are no longer
  supported. (@rfratto)

### Deprecations

- The binary names `agent`, `agentctl`, and `agent-operator` have been
  deprecated and will be renamed to `grafana-agent`, `grafana-agentctl`, and
  `grafana-agent-operator` in the v0.31.0 release.

### Features

- Add `agentctl test-logs` command to allow testing log configurations by redirecting
  collected logs to standard output. This can be useful for debugging. (@jcreixell)

    forwarding it to other `otelcol` components. (@rfratto)

  - `otelcol.exporter.otlp` accepts data from `otelcol` components and sends
    it to a gRPC server using the OTLP protocol. (@rfratto)

  - `otelcol.exporter.otlphttp` accepts data from `otelcol` components and
    sends it to an HTTP server using the OTLP protocol. (@tpaschalis)

  - `otelcol.auth.basic` performs basic authentication for `otelcol`
    components that support authentication extensions. (@rfratto)

  - `otelcol.receiver.jeager` receives Jaeger-formatted traces. Data can then
    be forwarded to other `otelcol` components. (@rfratto)

  - `otelcol.processor.memory_limiter` periodically checks memory usage and
    drops data or forces a garbage collection if the defined limits are
    exceeded. (@tpaschalis)

  - `otelcol.auth.bearer` performs bearer token authentication for `otelcol`
    components that support authentication extensions. (@rfratto)

  - `otelcol.auth.headers` attaches custom request headers to `otelcol`
    components that support authentication extensions. (@rfratto)

  agent mode. Support bundles are zip files of commonly-requested information
  that can be used to debug a running agent. (@tpaschalis)

### Enhancements

- Update OpenTelemetry Collector dependency to v0.61.0. (@rfratto)

- Add caching to Prometheus relabel component. (@mattdurham)

- Grafana Agent Flow: add `agent_resources_*` metrics which explain basic
  platform-agnostic metrics. These metrics assist with basic monitoring of
  Grafana Agent, but are not meant to act as a replacement for fully featured
  components like `prometheus.integration.node_exporter`. (@rfratto)

- Enable field label in TenantStageSpec of PodLogs pipeline. (@siiimooon)

- Enable reporting of enabled integrations. (@marctc)

- Grafana Agent Flow: `prometheus.remote_write` and `prometheus.relabel` will
  now export receivers immediately, removing the need for dependant components
  to be evaluated twice at process startup. (@rfratto)

- Use Go 1.19.3 for builds. (@rfratto)

v0.28.1 (2022-11-03)
--------------------

### Security

- Update Docker base image to resolve OpenSSL vulnerabilities CVE-2022-3602 and
  CVE-2022-3786. Grafana Agent does not use OpenSSL, so we do not believe it is
  vulnerable to these issues, but the base image has been updated to remove the
  report from image scanners. (@rfratto)

v0.28.0 (2022-09-29)
--------------------

### Features

- Introduce Grafana Agent Flow, an experimental "programmable pipeline" runtime
  mode which improves how to configure and debug Grafana Agent by using
  components. (@captncraig, @karengermond, @marctc, @mattdurham, @rfratto,
  @rlankfo, @tpaschalis)

- Introduce Blackbox exporter integration. (@marctc)

### Enhancements

v0.27.1 (2022-09-09)
--------------------

> **NOTE**: ARMv6 Docker images are no longer being published.
>
> We have stopped publishing Docker images for ARMv6 platforms.
> This is due to the new Ubuntu base image we are using that does not support ARMv6.
> The new Ubuntu base image has less reported CVEs, and allows us to provide more
> secure Docker images. We will still continue to publish ARMv6 release binaries and
> deb/rpm packages.

### Other changes

- Update several go dependencies to resolve warnings from certain security scanning tools. None of the resolved vulnerabilities were known to be exploitable through the agent. (@captncraig)

- It is now possible to compile Grafana Agent using Go 1.19. (@rfratto)

v0.26.1 (2022-07-25)
--------------------

> **BREAKING CHANGES**: This release has breaking changes. Please read entries
> carefully and consult the [upgrade guide][] for specific instructions.

### Breaking changes

  via the `integrations-next` feature flag. Use `-enable-features=integrations-next` to use
  this integration. (@kpelelis, @domas)

- Introduce SNMP exporter integration. (@v-zhuravlev)

- Configure the agent to report the use of feature flags to grafana.com. (@marctc)

### Enhancements

v0.24.0 (2022-04-07)
--------------------

> **BREAKING CHANGES**: This release has breaking changes. Please read entries
> carefully and consult the [upgrade guide][] for specific instructions.
>
> **GRAFANA AGENT OPERATOR USERS**: As of this release, Grafana Agent Operator
> does not support versions of Grafana Agent prior to v0.24.0.

### Breaking changes

- The following metrics will now be prefixed with `agent_dskit_` instead of
  `cortex_`: `cortex_kv_request_duration_seconds`,
  `cortex_member_consul_heartbeats_total`, `cortex_member_ring_tokens_owned`,
  `cortex_member_ring_tokens_to_own`, `cortex_ring_member_ownership_percent`,
  `cortex_ring_members`, `cortex_ring_oldest_member_timestamp`,
  `cortex_ring_tokens_owned`, `cortex_ring_tokens_total`. (@rlankfo)

- Traces: the `traces_spanmetrics_calls_total_total` metric has been renamed to
  `traces_spanmetrics_calls_total` (@fredr)

- Two new flags, `-server.http.enable-tls` and `-server.grpc.enable-tls` must
  be provided to explicitly enable TLS support. This is a change of the
  previous behavior where TLS support was enabled when a certificate pair was
  provided. (@rfratto)

- Many command line flags starting with `-server.` block have been renamed.
  (@rfratto)

- The `-log.level` and `-log.format` flags are removed in favor of being set in
  the configuration file. (@rfratto)

- Flags for configuring TLS have been removed in favor of being set in the
  configuration file. (@rfratto)

- Dynamic reload is no longer supported for deprecated server block fields.
  Changing a deprecated field will be ignored and cause the reload to fail.
  (@rfratto)

- The default HTTP listen address is now `127.0.0.1:12345`. Use the
  `-server.http.address` flag to change this value. (@rfratto)

- The default gRPC listen address is now `127.0.0.1:12346`. Use the
  `-server.grpc.address` flag to change this value. (@rfratto)

- `-reload-addr` and `-reload-port` have been removed. They are no longer
  necessary as the primary HTTP server is now static and can't be shut down in
  the middle of a `/-/reload` call. (@rfratto)

- (Only impacts `integrations-next` feature flag) Many integrations have been
  renamed to better represent what they are integrating with. For example,
  `redis_exporter` is now `redis`. This change requires updating
  `integrations-next`-enabled configuration files. This change also changes
  integration names shown in metric labels. (@rfratto)

- The deprecated `-prometheus.*` flags have been removed in favor of
  their `-metrics.*` counterparts. The `-prometheus.*` flags were first
  deprecated in v0.19.0. (@rfratto)

### Deprecations

- Most fields in the `server` block of the configuration file are
  now deprecated in favor of command line flags. These fields will be removed
  in the v0.26.0 release. Please consult the upgrade guide for more information
  and rationale. (@rfratto)

### Features

- Added config read API support to GrafanaAgent Custom Resource Definition.
  (@shamsalmon)

- Added consulagent_sd to target discovery. (@chuckyz)

- Introduce EXPERIMENTAL support for dynamic configuration. (@mattdurham)

- Introduced endpoint that accepts remote_write requests and pushes metrics data directly into an instance's WAL. (@tpaschalis)

- Added builds for linux/ppc64le. (@aklyachkin)

### Enhancements

- Tracing: Exporters can now be configured to use OAuth. (@canuteson)

- Strengthen readiness check for metrics instances. (@tpaschalis)

- Parameterize namespace field in sample K8s logs manifests (@hjet)

- Upgrade to Loki k87. (@rlankfo)

### Bugfixes

- Fix Kubernetes manifests to use port `4317` for OTLP instead of the previous
  `55680` in line with the default exposed port in the agent.

- Ensure singleton integrations are honored in v2 integrations (@mattdurham)

- Tracing: `const_labels` is now correctly parsed in the remote write exporter.
  (@fredr)

- integrations-next: Fix race condition where metrics endpoints for
  integrations may disappear after reloading the config file. (@rfratto)

- Removed the `server.path_prefix` field which would break various features in
  Grafana Agent when set. (@rfratto)

- Fix issue where installing the DEB/RPM packages would overwrite the existing
  config files and environment files. (@rfratto)

- Set `grafanaDashboardFolder` as top level key in the mixin. (@Duologic)

- Operator: Custom Secrets or ConfigMaps to mount will no longer collide with
  the path name of the default secret mount. As a side effect of this bugfix,
  custom Secrets will now be mounted at
  `/var/lib/grafana-agent/extra-secrets/<secret name>` and custom ConfigMaps
  will now be mounted at `/var/lib/grafana-agent/extra-configmaps/<configmap
  name>`. This is not a breaking change as it was previously impossible to
  properly provide these custom mounts. (@rfratto)

- Flags accidentally prefixed with `-metrics.service..` (two `.` in a row) have
  now been fixed to only have one `.`. (@rfratto)

- Protect concurrent writes to the WAL in the remote write exporter (@mapno)

### Other changes

### Bugfixes

- Fix race condition that may occur and result in a panic when initializing
  scraping service cluster. (@rfratto)

v0.16.1 (2021-06-22)
--------------------

### Bugfixes

v0.15.0 (2021-06-03)
--------------------

> **BREAKING CHANGES**: This release has breaking changes. Please read entries
> carefully and consult the [upgrade guide][] for specific instructions.

### Breaking Changes

- The configuration of Tempo Autologging has changed. (@mapno)

### Features

- Add support for exemplars. (@mapno)

### Enhancements

- Add the option to log to stdout instead of a Loki instance. (@joe-elliott)

- Update Cortex dependency to v1.8.0.

- Running the Agent as a DaemonSet with host_filter and role: pod should no
  longer cause unnecessary load against the Kubernetes SD API. (@rfratto)

- Update Prometheus to v2.27.0. (@mapno)

- Update Loki dependency to d88f3996eaa2. This is a non-release build, and was
  needed to support exemplars. (@mapno)

- Update Cortex dependency to d382e1d80eaf. This is a non-release build, and
  was needed to support exemplars. (@mapno)

### Bugfixes

- Host filter relabeling rules should now work. (@rfratto)

- Fixed issue where span metrics where being reported with wrong time unit.
  (@mapno)

### Other changes

- Intentionally order tracing processors. (@joe-elliott)

v0.14.0 (2021-05-24)
--------------------

> **BREAKING CHANGES**: This release has breaking changes. Please read entries
> carefully and consult the [upgrade guide][] for specific instructions.
>
> **STABILITY NOTICE**: As of this release, functionality that is not
> recommended for production use and is expected to change will be tagged
> interchangably as "experimental" or "beta."

### Security fixes

- The Scraping service API will now reject configs that read credentials from
  disk by default. This prevents malicious users from reading arbitrary files
  and sending their contents over the network. The old behavior can be
  re-enabled by setting `dangerous_allow_reading_files: true` in the scraping
  service config. (@rfratto)

### Breaking changes

- Configuration for SigV4 has changed. (@rfratto)

### Deprecations

- `push_config` is now supplanted by `remote_block` and `batch`. `push_config`
  will be removed in a future version (@mapno)

### Features

- (beta) New integration: windows_exporter (@mattdurham)

- (beta) Grafana Agent Windows Installer is now included as a release artifact.
  (@mattdurham)

- Official M1 Mac release builds will now be generated! Look for
  `agent-darwin-arm64` and `agentctl-darwin-arm64` in the release assets.
  (@rfratto)

- Add support for running as a Windows service (@mattdurham)

- (beta) Add /-/reload support. It is not recommended to invoke `/-/reload`
  against the main HTTP server. Instead, two new command-line flags have been
  added: `--reload-addr` and `--reload-port`. These will launch a
  `/-/reload`-only HTTP server that can be used to safely reload the Agent's
  state.  (@rfratto)

- Add a /-/config endpoint. This endpoint will return the current configuration
  file with defaults applied that the Agent has loaded from disk. (@rfratto)

- (beta) Support generating metrics and exposing them via a Prometheus exporter
  from span data. (@yeya24)

- Tail-based sampling for tracing pipelines (@mapno)

- Added Automatic Logging feature for Tempo (@joe-elliott)

- Disallow reading files from within scraping service configs by default.
  (@rfratto)

- Add remote write for span metrics (@mapno)

### Enhancements

- Support compression for trace export. (@mdisibio)

- Add global remote_write configuration that is shared between all instances
  and integrations. (@mattdurham)

- Go 1.16 is now used for all builds of the Agent. (@rfratto)

- Update Prometheus dependency to v2.26.0. (@rfratto)

- Upgrade `go.opentelemetry.io/collector` to v0.21.0 (@mapno)

- Add kafka trace receiver (@mapno)

- Support mirroring a trace pipeline to multiple backends (@mapno)

- Add `headers` field in `remote_write` config for Tempo. `headers` specifies
  HTTP headers to forward to the remote endpoint. (@alexbiehl)

- Add silent uninstall to Windows Uninstaller. (@mattdurham)

### Bugfixes

- Native Darwin arm64 builds will no longer crash when writing metrics to the
  WAL. (@rfratto)

- Remote write endpoints that never function across the lifetime of the Agent
  will no longer prevent the WAL from being truncated. (@rfratto)

- Bring back FreeBSD support. (@rfratto)

- agentctl will no longer leak WAL resources when retrieving WAL stats.
  (@rfratto)

- Ensure defaults are applied to undefined sections in config file. This fixes
  a problem where integrations didn't work if `prometheus:` wasn't configured.
  (@rfratto)

- Fixed issue where automatic logging double logged "svc". (@joe-elliott)

### Other changes

- The Grafana Cloud Agent has been renamed to the Grafana Agent. (@rfratto)

- Instance configs uploaded to the Config Store API will no longer be stored
  along with the global Prometheus defaults. This is done to allow globals to
  be updated and re-apply the new global defaults to the configs from the
  Config Store. (@rfratto)

- The User-Agent header sent for logs will now be `GrafanaAgent/<version>`
  (@rfratto)

- Add `tempo_spanmetrics` namespace in spanmetrics (@mapno)

v0.13.1 (2021-04-09)
--------------------

### Bugfixes

- Validate that incoming scraped metrics do not have an empty label set or a
  label set with duplicate labels, mirroring the behavior of Prometheus.
  (@rfratto)

v0.13.0 (2021-02-25)
--------------------

> The primary branch name has changed from `master` to `main`. You may have to
> update your local checkouts of the repository to point at the new branch name.

### Features

- postgres_exporter: Support query_path and disable_default_metrics. (@rfratto)

### Enhancements

- Support other architectures in installation script. (@rfratto)

- Allow specifying custom wal_truncate_frequency per integration. (@rfratto)

- The SigV4 region can now be inferred using the shared config (at
  `$HOME/.aws/config`) or environment variables (via `AWS_CONFIG`). (@rfratto)

- Update Prometheus dependency to v2.25.0. (@rfratto)

### Bugfixes

- Not providing an `-addr` flag for `agentctl config-sync` will no longer
  report an error and will instead use the pre-existing default value.
  (@rfratto)

- Fixed a bug from v0.12.0 where the Loki installation script failed because
  positions_directory was not set. (@rfratto)

- Reduce the likelihood of dataloss during a remote_write-side outage by
  increasing the default wal_truncation_frequency to 60m and preventing the WAL
  from being truncated if the last truncation timestamp hasn't changed. This
  change increases the size of the WAL on average, and users may configure a
  lower wal_truncation_frequency to deliberately choose a smaller WAL over
  write guarantees. (@rfratto)

- Add the ability to read and serve HTTPS integration metrics when given a set
  certificates (@mattdurham)

v0.12.0 (2021-02-05)
--------------------

> **BREAKING CHANGES**: This release has breaking changes. Please read entries
> carefully and consult the [upgrade guide][] for specific instructions.

### Breaking Changes

- The configuration format for the `loki` block has changed. (@rfratto)

- The configuration format for the `tempo` block has changed. (@rfratto)

### Features

- Support for multiple Loki Promtail instances has been added. (@rfratto)

- Support for multiple Tempo instances has been added. (@rfratto)

- Added [ElasticSearch exporter](https://github.com/justwatchcom/elasticsearch_exporter)
  integration. (@colega)

### Enhancements

- `.deb` and `.rpm` packages are now generated for all supported architectures.
  The architecture of the AMD64 package in the filename has been renamed to
  `amd64` to stay synchronized with the architecture name presented from other
  release assets. (@rfratto)

- The `/agent/api/v1/targets` API will now include discovered labels on the
  target pre-relabeling in a `discovered_labels` field. (@rfratto)

- Update Loki to 59a34f9867ce. This is a non-release build, and was needed to
  support multiple Loki instances. (@rfratto)

- Scraping service: Unhealthy Agents in the ring will no longer cause job
  distribution to fail. (@rfratto)

- Scraping service: Cortex ring metrics (prefixed with cortex_ring_) will now
  be registered for tracking the state of the hash ring. (@rfratto)

- Scraping service: instance config ownership is now determined by the hash of
  the instance config name instead of the entire config. This means that
  updating a config is guaranteed to always hash to the same Agent, reducing
  the number of metrics gaps. (@rfratto)

- Only keep a handful of K8s API server metrics by default to reduce default
  active series usage. (@hjet)

- Go 1.15.8 is now used for all distributions of the Agent. (@rfratto)

### Bugfixes

- `agentctl config-check` will now work correctly when the supplied config file
  contains integrations. (@hoenn)

v0.11.0 (2021-01-20)
--------------------

### Features

- ARMv6 builds of `agent` and `agentctl` will now be included in releases to
  expand Agent support to cover all models of Raspberry Pis. ARMv6 docker
  builds are also now available. (@rfratto)

- Added `config-check` subcommand for `agentctl` that can be used to validate
  Agent configuration files before attempting to load them in the `agent`
  itself. (@56quarters)

### Enhancements

- A sigv4 install script for Prometheus has been added. (@rfratto)

- NAMESPACE may be passed as an environment variable to the Kubernetes install
  scripts to specify an installation namespace. (@rfratto)

### Bugfixes

- The K8s API server scrape job will use the API server Service name when
  resolving IP addresses for Prometheus service discovery using the "Endpoints"
  role. (@hjet)

- The K8s manifests will no longer include the `default/kubernetes` job twice
  in both the DaemonSet and the Deployment. (@rfratto)

v0.10.0 (2021-01-13)
--------------------

### Features

- Prometheus `remote_write` now supports SigV4 authentication using the
  [AWS default credentials chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html).
  This enables the Agent to send metrics to Amazon Managed Prometheus without
  needing the [SigV4 Proxy](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sigv4-proxy).
  (@rfratto)

### Enhancements

- Update `redis_exporter` to v1.15.0. (@rfratto)

- `memcached_exporter` has been updated to v0.8.0. (@rfratto)

- `process-exporter` has been updated to v0.7.5. (@rfratto)

- `wal_cleanup_age` and `wal_cleanup_period` have been added to the top-level
  Prometheus configuration section. These settings control how Write Ahead Logs
  (WALs) that are not associated with any instances are cleaned up. By default,
  WALs not associated with an instance that have not been written in the last
  12 hours are eligible to be cleaned up. This cleanup can be disabled by
  setting `wal_cleanup_period` to `0`. (@56quarters)

- Configuring logs to read from the systemd journal should now work on journals
  that use +ZSTD compression. (@rfratto)

### Bugfixes

- Integrations will now function if the HTTP listen address was set to a value
  other than the default. (@mattdurham)

- The default Loki installation will now be able to write its positions file.
  This was prevented by accidentally writing to a readonly volume mount.
  (@rfratto)

v0.9.1 (2021-01-04)
-------------------

### Enhancements

- agentctl will now be installed by the rpm and deb packages as
  `grafana-agentctl`. (@rfratto)

v0.9.0 (2020-12-10)
-------------------

### Features

- Add support to configure TLS config for the Tempo exporter to use
  insecure_skip_verify to disable TLS chain verification. (@bombsimon)

- Add `sample-stats` to `agentctl` to search the WAL and return a summary of
  samples of series matching the given label selector. (@simonswine)

- New integration:
  [postgres_exporter](https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter)
  (@rfratto)

- New integration:
  [statsd_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter) (@rfratto)

- New integration:
  [consul_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/consul_exporter) (@rfratto)

- Add optional environment variable substitution of configuration file.
  (@dcseifert)

### Enhancements

- `min_wal_time` and `max_wal_time` have been added to the instance config
  settings, guaranteeing that data in the WAL will exist for at least
  `min_wal_time` and will not exist for longer than `max_wal_time`. This change
  will increase the size of the WAL slightly but will prevent certain scenarios
  where data is deleted before it is sent. To revert back to the old behavior,
  set `min_wal_time` to `0s`. (@rfratto)

- Update `redis_exporter` to v1.13.1. (@rfratto)

- Bump OpenTelemetry-collector dependency to v0.16.0. (@bombsimon)

### Bugfixes

- Fix issue where the Tempo example manifest could not be applied because the
  port names were too long. (@rfratto)

- Fix issue where the Agent Kubernetes manifests may not load properly on AKS.
  (#279) (@rfratto)

### Other changes

- The User-Agent header sent for logs will now be `GrafanaCloudAgent/<version>`
  (@rfratto)

v0.8.0 (2020-11-06)
-------------------

### Features

- New integration: [dnsamsq_exporter](https://github.com/google/dnsamsq_exporter)
  (@rfratto).

- New integration: [memcached_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/memcached_exporter)
  (@rfratto).

### Enhancements

- Add `<integration name>_build_info` metric to all integrations. The build
  info displayed will match the build information of the Agent and _not_ the
  embedded exporter. This metric is used by community dashboards, so adding it
  to the Agent increases compatibility with existing dashboards that depend on
  it existing. (@rfratto)

- Bump OpenTelemetry-collector dependency to 0.14.0 (@joe-elliott)

### Bugfixes

- Error messages when retrieving configs from the KV store will now be logged,
  rather than just logging a generic message saying that retrieving the config
  has failed. (@rfratto)

v0.7.2 (2020-10-29)
-------------------

### Enhancements

- Bump Prometheus dependency to 2.21. (@rfratto)

- Bump OpenTelemetry-collector dependency to 0.13.0 (@rfratto)

- Bump Promtail dependency to 2.0. (@rfratto)

- Enhance host_filtering mode to support targets from Docker Swarm and Consul.
  Also, add a `host_filter_relabel_configs` to that will apply relabeling rules
  for determining if a target should be dropped. Add a documentation section
  explaining all of this in detail. (@rfratto)

### Bugfixes

- Fix deb package prerm script so that it stops the agent on package removal.
  (@jdbaldry)

- Fix issue where the `push_config` for Tempo field was expected to be
  `remote_write`. `push_config` now works as expected. (@rfratto)

v0.7.1 (2020-10-23)
-------------------

### Bugfixes

- Fix issue where ARM binaries were not published with the GitHub release.

v0.7.0 (2020-10-23)
-------------------

### Features

- Added Tracing Support. (@joe-elliott)

- Add RPM and deb packaging. (@jdbaldry, @simon6372)

- arm64 and arm/v7 Docker containers and release builds are now available for
  `agent` and `agentctl`. (@rfratto)

- Add `wal-stats` and `target-stats` tooling to `agentctl` to discover WAL and
  cardinality issues. (@rfratto)

- [mysqld_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter) is now
  embedded and available as an integration. (@rfratto)

- [redis_exporter](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) is now embedded
  and available as an integration. (@dafydd-t)

### Enhancements

- Resharding the cluster when using the scraping service mode now supports
  timeouts through `reshard_timeout`. The default value is `30s.` This timeout
  applies to cluster-wide reshards (performed when joining and leaving the
  cluster) and local reshards (done on the `reshard_interval`). (@rfratto)

### Bugfixes

- Fix issue where integrations crashed with instance_mode was set to `distinct`
  (@rfratto)

- Fix issue where the `agent` integration did not work on Windows (@rfratto).

- Support URL-encoded paths in the scraping service API. (@rfratto)

- The instance label written from replace_instance_label can now be overwritten
  with relabel_configs. This bugfix slightly modifies the behavior of what data
  is stored. The final instance label will now be stored in the WAL rather than
  computed by remote_write. This change should not negatively affect existing
  users. (@rfratto)

v0.6.1 (2020-04-11)
-------------------

### Bugfixes

- Fix issue where build information was empty when running the Agent with
  --version. (@rfratto)

- Fix issue where updating a config in the scraping service may fail to pick up
  new targets. (@rfratto)

- Fix deadlock that slowly prevents the Agent from scraping targets at a high
  scrape volume. (@rfratto)

v0.6.0 (2020-09-04)
-------------------

### Breaking Changes

- The Configs API will now disallow two instance configs having multiple
  `scrape_configs` with the same `job_name`. This was needed for the instance
  sharing mode, where combined instances may have duplicate `job_names` across
  their `scrape_configs`. This brings the scraping service more in line with
  Prometheus, where `job_names` must globally be unique. This change also
  disallows concurrent requests to the put/apply config API endpoint to prevent
  a race condition of two conflicting configs being applied at the same time.
  (@rfratto)

### Deprecations

- `use_hostname_label` is now supplanted by `replace_instance_label`.
  `use_hostname_label` will be removed in a future version. (@rfratto)

### Features

- The Grafana Agent can now collect logs and send to Loki. This is done by
  embedding Promtail, the official Loki log collection client. (@rfratto)

- Integrations can now be enabled without scraping. Set scrape_integrations to
  `false` at the `integrations` key or within the specific integration you
  don't want to scrape. This is useful when another Agent or Prometheus server
  will scrape the integration. (@rfratto)

- [process-exporter](https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter) is now
  embedded as `process_exporter`. The hypen has been changed to an underscore
  in the config file to retain consistency with `node_exporter`. (@rfratto)

### Enhancements

- A new config option, `replace_instance_label`, is now available for use with
  integrations. When this is true, the instance label for all metrics coming
  from an integration will be replaced with the machine's hostname rather than
  127.0.0.1. (@rfratto)

- The embedded Prometheus version has been updated to 2.20.1. (@rfratto,
  @gotjosh)

- The User-Agent header written by the Agent when remote_writing will now be
  `GrafanaCloudAgent/<Version>` instead of `Prometheus/<Prometheus Version>`.
  (@rfratto)

- The subsystems of the Agent (`prometheus`, `loki`) are now made optional.
  Enabling integrations also implicitly enables the associated subsystem. For
  example, enabling the `agent` or `node_exporter` integration will force the
  `prometheus` subsystem to be enabled.  (@rfratto)

### Bugfixes

- The documentation for Tanka configs is now correct. (@amckinley)

- Minor corrections and spelling issues have been fixed in the Overview
  documentation. (@amckinley)

- The new default of `shared` instances mode broke the metric value for
  `agent_prometheus_active_configs`, which was tracking the number of combined
  configs (i.e., number of launched instances). This metric has been fixed and
  a new metric, `agent_prometheus_active_instances`, has been added to track
  the numbger of launched instances. If instance sharing is not enabled, both
  metrics will share the same value. (@rfratto)

- `remote_write` names in a group will no longer be copied from the
  remote_write names of the first instance in the group. Rather, all
  remote_write names will be generated based on the first 6 characters of the
  group hash and the first six characters of the remote_write hash. (@rfratto)

- Fix a panic that may occur during shutdown if the WAL is closed in the middle
  of the WAL being truncated. (@rfratto)

v0.5.0 (2020-08-12)
-------------------

### Features

- A [scrape targets API](https://github.com/grafana/agent/blob/main/docs/api.md#list-current-scrape-targets)
  has been added to show every target the Agent is currently scraping, when it
  was last scraped, how long it took to scrape, and errors from the last
  scrape, if any. (@rfratto)

- "Shared Instance Mode" is the new default mode for spawning Prometheus
  instances, and will improve CPU and memory usage for users of integrations
  and the scraping service. (@rfratto)

### Enhancements

- Memory stability and utilization of the WAL has been improved, and the
  reported number of active series in the WAL will stop double-counting
  recently churned series. (@rfratto)

- Changing scrape_configs and remote_write configs for an instance will now be
  dynamically applied without restarting the instance. This will result in less
  missing metrics for users of the scraping service that change a config.
  (@rfratto)

- The Tanka configuration now uses k8s-alpha. (@duologic)

### Bugfixes

- The Tanka configuration will now also deploy a single-replica deployment
  specifically for scraping the Kubernetes API. This deployment acts together
  with the Daemonset to scrape the full cluster and the control plane.
  (@gotjosh)

- The node_exporter filesystem collector will now work on Linux systems without
  needing to manually set the blocklist and allowlist of filesystems.
  (@rfratto)

v0.4.0 (2020-06-18)
-------------------

### Features

- Support for integrations has been added. Integrations can be any embedded
  tool, but are currently used for embedding exporters and generating scrape
  configs. (@rfratto)

- node_exporter has been added as an integration. This is the full version of
  node_exporter with the same configuration options. (@rfratto)

- An Agent integration that makes the Agent automatically scrape itself has
  been added. (@rfratto)

### Enhancements

- The WAL can now be truncated if running the Agent without any remote_write
  endpoints. (@rfratto)

### Bugfixes

- Prevent the Agent from crashing when a global Prometheus config stanza is not
  provided. (@robx)

- Enable agent host_filter in the Tanka configs, which was disabled by default
  by mistake. (@rfratto)

v0.3.2 (2020-05-29)
-------------------

### Features

- Tanka configs that deploy the scraping service mode are now available
  (@rfratto)

- A k3d example has been added as a counterpart to the docker-compose example.
  (@rfratto)

### Enhancements

- Labels provided by the default deployment of the Agent (Kubernetes and Tanka)
  have been changed to align with the latest changes to grafana/jsonnet-libs.
  The old `instance` label is now called `pod`, and the new `instance` label is
  unique. A `container` label has also been added. The Agent mixin has been
  subsequently updated to also incorporate these label changes. (@rfratto)

- The `remote_write` and `scrape_config` sections now share the same
  validations as Prometheus (@rfratto)

- Setting `wal_truncation_frequency` to less than the scrape interval is now
  disallowed (@rfratto)

### Bugfixes

- A deadlock in scraping service mode when updating a config that shards to the
  same node has been fixed (@rfratto)

- `remote_write` config stanzas will no longer ignore `password_file`
  (@rfratto)

- `scrape_config` client secrets (e.g., basic auth, bearer token,
  `password_file`) will now be properly retained in scraping service mode
  (@rfratto)

- Labels for CPU, RX, and TX graphs in the Agent Operational dashboard now
  correctly show the pod name of the Agent instead of the exporter name.
  (@rfratto)

v0.3.1 (2020-05-20)
-------------------

### Features

- The Agent has upgraded its vendored Prometheus to v2.18.1 (@gotjosh,
  @rfratto)

### Bugfixes

- A typo in the Tanka configs and Kubernetes manifests that prevents the Agent
  launching with v0.3.0 has been fixed (@captncraig)

- Fixed a bug where Tanka mixins could not be used due to an issue with the
  folder placement enhancement (@rfratto)

### Enhancements

- `agentctl` and the config API will now validate that the YAML they receive
  are valid instance configs. (@rfratto)

v0.3.0 (2020-05-13)
-------------------

### Features

- A third operational mode called "scraping service mode" has been added. A KV
  store is used to store instance configs which are distributed amongst a
  clustered set of Agent processes, dividing the total scrape load across each
  agent. An API is exposed on the Agents to list, create, update, and delete
  instance configurations from the KV store. (@rfratto)

- An "agentctl" binary has been released to interact with the new instance
  config management API created by the "scraping service mode." (@rfratto,
  @hoenn)

- The Agent now includes readiness and healthiness endpoints. (@rfratto)

### Enhancements

- The YAML files are now parsed strictly and an invalid YAML will generate an
  error at runtime. (@hoenn)

- The default build mode for the Docker containers is now release, not debug.
  (@rfratto)

- The Grafana Agent Tanka Mixins now are placed in an "Agent" folder within
  Grafana. (@cyriltovena)

v0.2.0 (2020-04-09)
-------------------

### Features

- The Prometheus remote write protocol will now send scraped metadata (metric
  name, help, type and unit). This results in almost negligent bytes sent
  increase as metadata is only sent every minute. It is on by default.
  (@gotjosh)

  These metrics are available to monitor metadata being sent:
  - `prometheus_remote_storage_succeeded_metadata_total`
  - `prometheus_remote_storage_failed_metadata_total`
  - `prometheus_remote_storage_retried_metadata_total`
  - `prometheus_remote_storage_sent_batch_duration_seconds` and
    `prometheus_remote_storage_sent_bytes_total` have a new label “type” with
    the values of `metadata` or `samples`.

### Enhancements

- The Agent has upgraded its vendored Prometheus to v2.17.1 (@rfratto)

### Bugfixes

- Invalid configs passed to the agent will now stop the process after they are
  logged as invalid; previously the Agent process would continue. (@rfratto)

- Enabling host_filter will now allow metrics from node role Kubernetes service
  discovery to be scraped properly (e.g., cAdvisor, Kubelet). (@rfratto)

v0.1.1 (2020-03-16)
-------------------

### Other changes

- Nits in documentation (@sh0rez)

- Fix various dashboard mixin problems from v0.1.0 (@rfratto)

- Pass through release tag to `docker build` (@rfratto)

v0.1.0 (2020-03-16)
-------------------

> First release!

### Features

- Support for scraping Prometheus metrics and sharding the agent through the
  presence of a `host_filter` flag within the Agent configuration file.
