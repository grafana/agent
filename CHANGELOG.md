# v0.14.0 (2021-05-24)

BREAKING CHANGE: This release has a breaking change for SigV4 support. Please
read the release notes carefully and our [migration
guide](./docs/migration-guide.md) to help migrate your configuration files to
the new format.

BREAKING CHANGE: For security, the scraping service config API will reject
configs that read credentials from disk to prevent malicious users from reading
artbirary files and sending their contents over the network. The old behavior
can be achieved by enabling `dangerous_allow_reading_files` in the scraping
service config.

As of this release, functionality that is not recommended for production use
and is expected to change will be tagged interchangably as "experimental" or
"beta."

- [FEATURE] (beta) New integration: windows_exporter (@mattdurham)

- [FEATURE] (beta) Grafana Agent Windows Installer is now included as a release
  artifact. (@mattdurham)

- [FEATURE] Official M1 Mac release builds will now be generated! Look for
  `agent-darwin-arm64` and `agentctl-darwin-arm64` in the release assets.
  (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] Add support for running as a Windows service (@mattdurham)

- [FEATURE] (beta) Add /-/reload support. It is not recommended to invoke
  `/-/reload` against the main HTTP server. Instead, two new command-line flags
  have been added: `--reload-addr` and `--reload-port`. These will launch a
  `/-/reload`-only HTTP server that can be used to safely reload the Agent's
  state.  (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] Add a /-/config endpoint. This endpoint will return the current
  configuration file with defaults applied that the Agent has loaded from disk.
  (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] (beta) Support generating metrics and exposing them via a Prometheus exporter
  from span data. (@yeya24)

- [FEATURE] Tail-based sampling for tracing pipelines (@mapno)

- [FEATURE] Added Automatic Logging feature for Tempo (@joe-elliott)

- [FEATURE] Disallow reading files from within scraping service configs by
  default. (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] Add remote write for span metrics (@mapno)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Support compression for trace export. (@mdisibio)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Add global remote_write configuration that is shared between all
  instances and integrations. (@mattdurham)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Go 1.16 is now used for all builds of the Agent. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Update Prometheus dependency to v2.26.0. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Upgrade `go.opentelemetry.io/collector` to v0.21.0 (@mapno)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Add kafka trace receiver (@mapno)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Support mirroring a trace pipeline to multiple backends (@mapno)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Add  `headers` field in `remote_write` config for Tempo. `headers`
  specifies HTTP headers to forward to the remote endpoint. (@alexbiehl)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Add silent uninstall to Windows Uninstaller. (@mattdurham)

- [BUGFIX] Native Darwin arm64 builds will no longer crash when writing metrics
  to the WAL. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Remote write endpoints that never function across the lifetime of the
  Agent will no longer prevent the WAL from being truncated. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Bring back FreeBSD support. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] agentctl will no longer leak WAL resources when retrieving WAL stats. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Ensure defaults are applied to undefined sections in config file.
  This fixes a problem where integrations didn't work if `prometheus:` wasn't
  configured. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Fixed issue where automatic logging double logged "svc". (@joe-elliott)

- [CHANGE] The Grafana Cloud Agent has been renamed to the Grafana Agent.
  (@rfratto)

- [CHANGE] Instance configs uploaded to the Config Store API will no longer be
  stored along with the global Prometheus defaults. This is done to allow
  globals to be updated and re-apply the new global defaults to the configs from
  the Config Store. (@rfratto)

- [CHANGE] The User-Agent header sent for logs will now be
  `GrafanaAgent/<version>` (@rfratto)

- [CHANGE] Add `tempo_spanmetrics` namespace in spanmetrics (@mapno)

- [DEPRECATION] `push_config` is now supplanted by `remote_block` and `batch`.
  `push_config` will be removed in a future version (@mapno)

# v0.13.1 (2021-04-09)

- [BUGFIX] Validate that incoming scraped metrics do not have an empty label
  set or a label set with duplicate labels, mirroring the behavior of
  Prometheus. (@rfratto)

# v0.13.0 (2021-02-25)

The primary branch name has changed from `master` to `main`. You may have to
update your local checkouts of the repository to point at the new branch name.

- [FEATURE] postgres_exporter: Support query_path and disable_default_metrics. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Support other architectures in installation script. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Allow specifying custom wal_truncate_frequency per integration.
  (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] The SigV4 region can now be inferred using the shared config
  (at `$HOME/.aws/config`) or environment variables (via `AWS_CONFIG`).
  (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Update Prometheus dependency to v2.25.0. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Not providing an `-addr` flag for `agentctl config-sync` will no
  longer report an error and will instead use the pre-existing default value.
  (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Fixed a bug from v0.12.0 where the Loki installation script failed
  because positions_directory was not set. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] (#400) Reduce the likelihood of dataloss during a remote_write-side
  outage by increasing the default wal_truncation_frequency to 60m and preventing
  the WAL from being truncated if the last truncation timestamp hasn't changed.
  This change increases the size of the WAL on average, and users may configure
  a lower wal_truncation_frequency to deliberately choose a smaller WAL over
  write guarantees. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] (#368) Add the ability to read and serve HTTPS integration metrics when
  given a set certificates (@mattdurham)

# v0.12.0 (2021-02-05)

BREAKING CHANGES: This release has two breaking changes in the configuration
file. Please read the release notes carefully and our
[migration guide](./docs/migration-guide.md) to help migrate your configuration
files to the new format.

- [FEATURE] BREAKING CHANGE: Support for multiple Loki Promtail instances has
  been added, using the same `configs` array used by the Prometheus subsystem.
  (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] BREAKING CHANGE: Support for multiple Tempo instances has
  been added, using the same `configs` array used by the Prometheus subsystem.
  (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] Added [ElasticSearch exporter](https://github.com/justwatchcom/elasticsearch_exporter)
  integration. (@colega)

- [ENHANCEMENT] `.deb` and `.rpm` packages are now generated for all supported
  architectures. The architecture of the AMD64 package in the filename has
  been renamed to `amd64` to stay synchronized with the architecture name
  presented from other release assets. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] The `/agent/api/v1/targets` API will now include discovered labels
  on the target pre-relabeling in a `discovered_labels` field. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Update Loki to 59a34f9867ce. This is a non-release build, and was needed
  to support multiple Loki instances. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Scraping service: Unhealthy Agents in the ring will no longer
  cause job distribution to fail. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Scraping service: Cortex ring metrics (prefixed with
  cortex_ring_) will now be registered for tracking the state of the hash
  ring. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Scraping service: instance config ownership is now determined by
  the hash of the instance config name instead of the entire config. This means
  that updating a config is guaranteed to always hash to the same Agent,
  reducing the number of metrics gaps. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Only keep a handful of K8s API server metrics by default to reduce
  default active series usage. (@hjet)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Go 1.15.8 is now used for all distributions of the Agent.
  (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] `agentctl config-check` will now work correctly when the supplied
  config file contains integrations. (@hoenn)

# v0.11.0 (2021-01-20)

- [FEATURE] ARMv6 builds of `agent` and `agentctl` will now be included in
  releases to expand Agent support to cover all models of Raspberry Pis.
  ARMv6 docker builds are also now available.
  (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] Added `config-check` subcommand for `agentctl` that can be used
  to validate Agent configuration files before attempting to load them in the
  `agent` itself. (@56quarters)

- [ENHANCEMENT] A sigv4 install script for Prometheus has been added. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] NAMESPACE may be passed as an environment variable to the
  Kubernetes install scripts to specify an installation namespace. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] The K8s API server scrape job will use the API server Service name
  when resolving IP addresses for Prometheus service discovery using the
  "Endpoints" role. (@hjet)

- [BUGFIX] The K8s manifests will no longer include the `default/kubernetes` job
  twice in both the DaemonSet and the Deployment. (@rfratto)

# v0.10.0 (2021-01-13)

- [FEATURE] Prometheus `remote_write` now supports SigV4 authentication using
  the [AWS default credentials
  chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html).
  This enables the Agent to send metrics to Amazon Managed Prometheus without
  needing the [SigV4 Proxy](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sigv4-proxy).
  (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Update `redis_exporter` to v1.15.0. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] `memcached_exporter` has been updated to v0.8.0. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] `process-exporter` has been updated to v0.7.5. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] `wal_cleanup_age` and `wal_cleanup_period` have been added to the
  top-level Prometheus configuration section. These settings control how Write Ahead
  Logs (WALs) that are not associated with any instances are cleaned up. By default,
  WALs not associated with an instance that have not been written in the last 12 hours
  are eligible to be cleaned up. This cleanup can be disabled by setting `wal_cleanup_period`
  to `0`. (#304) (@56quarters)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Configuring logs to read from the systemd journal should now
  work on journals that use +ZSTD compression. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Integrations will now function if the HTTP listen address was set to
  a value other than the default. ([#206](https://github.com/grafana/agent/issues/206)) (@mattdurham)

- [BUGFIX] The default Loki installation will now be able to write its positions
  file. This was prevented by accidentally writing to a readonly volume mount.
  (@rfratto)

# v0.9.1 (2021-01-04)

- [ENHANCEMENT] agentctl will now be installed by the rpm and deb packages as
  `grafana-agentctl`. (@rfratto)

# v0.9.0 (2020-12-10)

- [FEATURE] Add support to configure TLS config for the Tempo exporter to use
  insecure_skip_verify to disable TLS chain verification. (@bombsimon)

- [FEATURE] Add `sample-stats` to `agentctl` to search the WAL and return a
  summary of samples of series matching the given label selector. (@simonswine)

- [FEATURE] New integration:
  [postgres_exporter](https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter) (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] New integration:
  [statsd_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter) (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] New integration:
  [consul_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/consul_exporter) (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] Add optional environment variable substitution of configuration
  file. (@dcseifert)

- [ENHANCEMENT] `min_wal_time` and `max_wal_time` have been added to the
  instance config settings, guaranteeing that data in the WAL will exist for at
  least `min_wal_time` and will not exist for longer than `max_wal_time`. This
  change will increase the size of the WAL slightly but will prevent certain
  scenarios where data is deleted before it is sent. To revert back to the old
  behavior, set `min_wal_time` to `0s`. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Update `redis_exporter` to v1.13.1. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Bump OpenTelemetry-collector dependency to v0.16.0. (@bombsimon)

- [BUGFIX] Fix issue where the Tempo example manifest could not be applied
  because the port names were too long. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Fix issue where the Agent Kubernetes manifests may not load properly
  on AKS. (#279) (@rfratto)

- [CHANGE] The User-Agent header sent for logs will now be
  `GrafanaCloudAgent/<version>` (@rfratto)

# v0.8.0 (2020-11-06)

- [FEATURE] New integration: [dnsamsq_exporter](https://github.com/google/dnsamsq_exporter)
  (@rfratto).

- [FEATURE] New integration: [memcached_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/memcached_exporter)
  (@rfratto).

- [ENHANCEMENT] Add `<integration name>_build_info` metric to all integrations.
  The build info displayed will match the build information of the Agent and
  *not* the embedded exporter. This metric is used by community dashboards, so
  adding it to the Agent increases compatibility with existing dashboards that
  depend on it existing. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Bump OpenTelemetry-collector dependency to 0.14.0 (@joe-elliott)

- [BUGFIX] Error messages when retrieving configs from the KV store will
  now be logged, rather than just logging a generic message saying that
  retrieving the config has failed. (@rfratto)

# v0.7.2 (2020-10-29)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Bump Prometheus dependency to 2.21. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Bump OpenTelemetry-collector dependency to 0.13.0 (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Bump Promtail dependency to 2.0. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Enhance host_filtering mode to support targets from Docker Swarm
  and Consul. Also, add a `host_filter_relabel_configs` to that will apply relabeling
  rules for determining if a target should be dropped. Add a documentation
  section explaining all of this in detail. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Fix deb package prerm script so that it stops the agent on package removal. (@jdbaldry)

- [BUGFIX] Fix issue where the `push_config` for Tempo field was expected to be
  `remote_write`. `push_config` now works as expected. (@rfratto)

# v0.7.1 (2020-10-23)

- [BUGFIX] Fix issue where ARM binaries were not published with the GitHub
  release.

# v0.7.0 (2020-10-23)

- [FEATURE] Added Tracing Support. (@joe-elliott)

- [FEATURE] Add RPM and deb packaging. (@jdbaldry) (@simon6372)

- [FEATURE] arm64 and arm/v7 Docker containers and release builds are now
  available for `agent` and `agentctl`. (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] Add `wal-stats` and `target-stats` tooling to `agentctl` to discover
  WAL and cardinality issues. (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] [mysqld_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter) is
  now embedded and available as an integration. (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] [redis_exporter](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) is
  now embedded and available as an integration. (@dafydd-t)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Resharding the cluster when using the scraping service mode now
  supports timeouts through `reshard_timeout`. The default value is `30s.` This
  timeout applies to cluster-wide reshards (performed when joining and leaving
  the cluster) and local reshards (done on the `reshard_interval`). (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Fix issue where integrations crashed with instance_mode was set to
  `distinct` (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Fix issue where the `agent` integration did not work on Windows
  (@rfratto).

- [BUGFIX] Support URL-encoded paths in the scraping service API. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] The instance label written from replace_instance_label can now be
  overwritten with relabel_configs. This bugfix slightly modifies the behavior
  of what data is stored. The final instance label will now be stored in the WAL
  rather than computed by remote_write. This change should not negatively effect
  existing users. (@rfratto)

# v0.6.1 (2020-04-11)

- [BUGFIX] Fix issue where build information was empty when running the Agent
  with --version. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Fix issue where updating a config in the scraping service may fail to
  pick up new targets. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Fix deadlock that slowly prevents the Agent from scraping targets at
  a high scrape volume. (@rfratto)

# v0.6.0 (2020-09-04)

- [FEATURE] The Grafana Agent can now collect logs and send to Loki. This
  is done by embedding Promtail, the official Loki log collection client.
  (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] Integrations can now be enabled without scraping. Set
  scrape_integrations to `false` at the `integrations` key or within the
  specific integration you don't want to scrape. This is useful when another
  Agent or Prometheus server will scrape the integration. (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] [process-exporter](https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter) is
  now embedded as `process_exporter`. The hypen has been changed to an
  underscore in the config file to retain consistency with `node_exporter`.
  (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] A new config option, `replace_instance_label`, is now available
  for use with integrations. When this is true, the instance label for all
  metrics coming from an integration will be replaced with the machine's
  hostname rather than 127.0.0.1. (@rfratto)

- [EHANCEMENT] The embedded Prometheus version has been updated to 2.20.1.
  (@rfratto, @gotjosh)

- [ENHANCEMENT] The User-Agent header written by the Agent when remote_writing
  will now be `GrafanaCloudAgent/<Version>` instead of `Prometheus/<Prometheus Version>`.
  (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] The subsystems of the Agent (`prometheus`, `loki`) are now made
  optional. Enabling integrations also implicitly enables the associated
  subsystem. For example, enabling the `agent` or `node_exporter` integration will
  force the `prometheus` subsystem to be enabled.  (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] The documentation for Tanka configs is now correct. (@amckinley)

- [BUGFIX] Minor corrections and spelling issues have been fixed in the Overview
  documentation. (@amckinley)

- [BUGFIX] The new default of `shared` instances mode broke the metric value for
  `agent_prometheus_active_configs`, which was tracking the number of combined
  configs (i.e., number of launched instances). This metric has been fixed and
  a new metric, `agent_prometheus_active_instances`, has been added to track
  the numbger of launched instances. If instance sharing is not enabled, both
  metrics will share the same value. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] The Configs API will now disallow two instance configs having
  multiple `scrape_configs` with the same `job_name`. THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE.
  This was needed for the instance sharing mode, where combined instances may
  have duplicate `job_names` across their `scrape_configs`. This brings the
  scraping service more in line with Prometheus, where `job_names` must globally
  be unique. This change also disallows concurrent requests to the put/apply
  config API endpoint to prevent a race condition of two conflicting configs
  being applied at the same time. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] `remote_write` names in a group will no longer be copied from the
  remote_write names of the first instance in the group. Rather, all
  remote_write names will be generated based on the first 6 characters of the
  group hash and the first six characters of the remote_write hash. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Fix a panic that may occur during shutdown if the WAL is closed in
  the middle of the WAL being truncated. (@rfratto)

- [DEPRECATION] `use_hostname_label` is now supplanted by
  `replace_instance_label`. `use_hostname_label` will be removed in a future
  version. (@rfratto)

# v0.5.0 (2020-08-12)

- [FEATURE] A [scrape targets API](https://github.com/grafana/agent/blob/main/docs/api.md#list-current-scrape-targets)
  has been added to show every target the Agent is currently scraping, when it
  was last scraped, how long it took to scrape, and errors from the last scrape,
  if any. (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE]  "Shared Instance Mode" is the new default mode for spawning
  Prometheus instances, and will improve CPU and memory usage for users of
  integrations and the scraping service. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Memory stability and utilization of the WAL has been improved,
  and the reported number of active series in the WAL will stop double-counting
  recently churned series. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Changing scrape_configs and remote_write configs for an instance
  will now be dynamically applied without restarting the instance. This will
  result in less missing metrics for users of the scraping service that change a
  config. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] The Tanka configuration now uses k8s-alpha. (@duologic)

- [BUGFIX] The Tanka configuration will now also deploy a single-replica
  deployment specifically for scraping the Kubernetes API. This deployment acts
  together with the Daemonset to scrape the full cluster and the control plane.
  (@gotjosh)

- [BUGFIX] The node_exporter filesystem collector will now work on Linux systems
  without needing to manually set the blocklist and allowlist of filesystems.
  (@rfratto)

# v0.4.0 (2020-06-18)

- [FEATURE] Support for integrations has been added. Integrations can be any
  embedded tool, but are currently used for embedding exporters and generating
  scrape configs. (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] node_exporter has been added as an integration. This is the full
  version of node_exporter with the same configuration options. (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] An Agent integration that makes the Agent automatically scrape
  itself has been added. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] The WAL can now be truncated if running the Agent without any
  remote_write endpoints. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Clarify server_config description in documentation. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Clarify wal_truncate_frequency and remote_flush_deadline in
  documentation. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Document /agent/api/v1/instances endpoint (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Be explicit about envsubst requirement for Kubernetes install
  script. (@robx)

- [BUGFIX] Prevent the Agent from crashing when a global Prometheus config
  stanza is not provided. (@robx)

- [BUGFIX] Enable agent host_filter in the Tanka configs, which was disabled by
  default by mistake. (@rfratto)

# v0.3.2 (2020-05-29)

- [FEATURE] Tanka configs that deploy the scraping service mode are now
  available (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] A k3d example has been added as a counterpart to the docker-compose
  example. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Labels provided by the default deployment of the Agent
  (Kubernetes and Tanka) have been changed to align with the latest changes to
  grafana/jsonnet-libs. The old `instance` label is now called `pod`, and the
  new `instance` label is unique. A `container` label has also been added. The
  Agent mixin has been subsequently updated to also incorporate these label
  changes. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] The `remote_write` and `scrape_config` sections now share the
  same validations as Prometheus (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] Setting `wal_truncation_frequency` to less than the scrape
  interval is now disallowed (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] A deadlock in scraping service mode when updating a config that
  shards to the same node has been fixed (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] `remote_write` config stanzas will no longer ignore `password_file`
  (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] `scrape_config` client secrets (e.g., basic auth, bearer token,
  `password_file`) will now be properly retained in scraping service mode
  (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Labels for CPU, RX, and TX graphs in the Agent Operational dashboard
  now correctly show the pod name of the Agent instead of the exporter name.
  (@rfratto)

# v0.3.1 (2020-05-20)

- [BUGFIX] A typo in the Tanka configs and Kubernetes manifests that prevents
  the Agent launching with v0.3.0 has been fixed (@captncraig)

- [BUGFIX] Fixed a bug where Tanka mixins could not be used due to an issue with
  the folder placement enhancement (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] `agentctl` and the config API will now validate that the YAML
  they receive are valid instance configs. (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] The Agent has upgraded its vendored Prometheus to v2.18.1
  (@gotjosh, @rfratto)

# v0.3.0 (2020-05-13)

- [FEATURE] A third operational mode called "scraping service mode" has been
  added. A KV store is used to store instance configs which are distributed
  amongst a clustered set of Agent processes, dividing the total scrape load
  across each agent. An API is exposed on the Agents to list, create, update,
  and delete instance configurations from the KV store. (@rfratto)

- [FEATURE] An "agentctl" binary has been released to interact with the new
  instance config management API created by the "scraping service mode."
  (@rfratto, @hoenn)

- [FEATURE] The Agent now includes readiness and healthiness endpoints.
  (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] The YAML files are now parsed strictly and an invalid YAML will
  generate an error at runtime. (@hoenn)

- [ENHANCEMENT] The default build mode for the Docker containers is now release,
  not debug. (@rfratto)

- [ENHANCEMENT] The Grafana Agent Tanka Mixins now are placed in an "Agent"
  folder within Grafana. (@cyriltovena)

# v0.2.0 (2020-04-09)

- [FEATURE] The Prometheus remote write protocol will now send scraped metadata (metric name, help, type and unit). This results in almost negligent bytes sent increase as metadata is only sent every minute. It is on by default. (@gotjosh)

  These metrics are available to monitor metadata being sent:
    - `prometheus_remote_storage_succeeded_metadata_total`
    - `prometheus_remote_storage_failed_metadata_total`
    - `prometheus_remote_storage_retried_metadata_total`
    - `prometheus_remote_storage_sent_batch_duration_seconds` and
      `prometheus_remote_storage_sent_bytes_total` have a new label “type” with
      the values of `metadata` or `samples`.

- [FEATURE] The Agent has upgraded its vendored Prometheus to v2.17.1 (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Invalid configs passed to the agent will now stop the process after they are logged as invalid; previously the Agent process would continue. (@rfratto)

- [BUGFIX] Enabling host_filter will now allow metrics from node role Kubernetes service discovery to be scraped properly (e.g., cAdvisor, Kubelet). (@rfratto)

# v0.1.1 (2020-03-16)

- Nits in documentation (@sh0rez)
- Fix various dashboard mixin problems from v0.1.0 (@rfratto)
- Pass through release tag to `docker build` (@rfratto)

# v0.1.0 (2020-03-16)

First (beta) release!

This release comes with support for scraping Prometheus metrics and
sharding the agent through the presence of a `host_filter` flag within the
Agent configuration file.

Note that enabling the `host_filter` flag currently works best when using our
preferred Kubernetes deployment, as it deploys the agent as a DaemonSet.
