# k8sutil

This folder is a temporary fork of the Prometheus Operator k8sutil, needed to
lower the version dependency on the Kubernetes client. Once all of the Grafana
Agent's dependencies have been updated to ones that use at least client version
0.21.0, this package can be removed and replaced with the official package.
