# install.sh is a really basic installer for the agent. It uses the existing
# Kubernetes YAML example and envsubst to fill in the details for remote write
# URL, username, and password.
#
# There are three ways to provide the inputs for installation:
#
# 1. Environment variables (REMOTE_WRITE_URL, REMOTE_WRITE_USERNAME,
#    REMOTE_WRITE_PASSWORD)
#
# 2. Flags (-l for remote write URL, -u for remote write username, -p for remote
#    write password)
#
# 3. stdin from prompts
#
# Flags override environment variables, and stdin is used as a fallback if a
# value wasn't given from a flag or environment variable. An empty username
# or password is acceptable, as it disables basic auth. However, a remote write
# URL must always be provided.
