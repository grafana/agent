# Configuration Reference

The Grafana Cloud Agent is configured in a YAML file (usually called
`agent.yaml`) which contains information on the Grafana Cloud Agent and its
Prometheus instances.

* [server_config](#server_config)
* [prometheus_config](#prometheus_config)
* [loki_config](#loki_config)
* [tempo_config](#tempo_config)
* [integrations_config](#integrations_config)

## File Format

To specify which configuration file to load, pass the `-config.file` flag at
the command line. The file is written in the [YAML
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), defined by the scheme below.
Brackets indicate that a parameter is optional. For non-list parameters the
value is set to the specified default.

Generic placeholders are defined as follows:

* `<boolean>`: a boolean that can take the values `true` or `false`
* `<int>`: any integer matching the regular expression `[1-9]+[0-9]*`
* `<duration>`: a duration matching the regular expression `[0-9]+(ns|us|Âµs|ms|[smh])`
* `<labelname>`: a string matching the regular expression `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`
* `<labelvalue>`: a string of unicode characters
* `<filename>`: a valid path relative to current working directory or an
    absolute path.
* `<host>`: a valid string consisting of a hostname or IP followed by an optional port number
* `<string>`: a regular string
* `<secret>`: a regular string that is a secret, such as a password

Support contents and default values of `agent.yaml`:

```yaml
# Configures the server of the Agent used to enable self-scraping.
[server: <server_config>]

# Configures Prometheus instances.
[prometheus: <prometheus_config>]

# Configures Loki log collection.
[loki: <loki_config>]

# Configures Tempo trace collection.
[tempo: <tempo_config>]

# Configures integrations for the Agent.
[integrations: <integrations_config>]
```

## server_config

The `server_config` block configures the Agent's behavior as an HTTP server,
gRPC server, and the log level for the whole process.

The Agent exposes an HTTP server for scraping its own metrics and gRPC for the
scraping service mode.

```yaml
# HTTP server listen host
[http_listen_address: <string>]

# HTTP server listen port
[http_listen_port: <int> | default = 80]

# gRPC server listen host. Unused.
[grpc_listen_address: <string>]

# gRPC server listen port. Unused.
[grpc_listen_port: <int> | default = 9095]

# Register instrumentation handlers (/metrics, etc.)
[register_instrumentation: <boolean> | default = true]

# Timeout for graceful shutdowns
[graceful_shutdown_timeout: <duration> | default = 30s]

# Read timeout for HTTP server
[http_server_read_timeout: <duration> | default = 30s]

# Write timeout for HTTP server
[http_server_write_timeout: <duration> | default = 30s]

# Idle timeout for HTTP server
[http_server_idle_timeout: <duration> | default = 120s]

# Max gRPC message size that can be received. Unused.

# Max gRPC message size that can be sent. Unused.
[grpc_server_max_send_msg_size: <int> | default = 4194304]

# Limit on the number of concurrent streams for gRPC calls (0 = unlimited).
# Unused.
[grpc_server_max_concurrent_streams: <int> | default = 100]

# Log only messages with the given severity or above. Supported values [debug,
# info, warn, error]. This level affects logging for the whole application, not
# just the Agent's HTTP/gRPC server.
[log_level: <string> | default = "info"]

# Base path to server all API routes from (e.g., /v1/). Unused.
[http_path_prefix: <string>]
```

## prometheus_config

The `prometheus_config` block is used to define a collection of Prometheus
Instances, each of which is its own mini-Agent. Most users will only need to
define one instance.

```yaml
# Configures the optional scraping service to cluster agents.
[scraping_service: <scraping_service_config>]

# Configures the gRPC client used for agents to connect to other
# clustered agents.
[scraping_service_client: <scraping_service_client_config>]

# Configure values for all Prometheus instances.
[global: <global_config>]

# Configure the directory used by instances to store their WAL.
[wal_directory: <string> | default = ""]

# The list of Prometheus instances to launch with the agent.
configs:
  [- <prometheus_instance_config>]

# If an instance crashes abnormally, how long should we wait before trying
# to restart it. 0s disables the backoff period and restarts the agent
# immediately.
[instance_restart_backoff: <duration> | default = "5s"]

# How to spawn instances based on instance configs. Supported values: shared,
# distinct.
[instance_mode: <string> | default = "shared"]
```

### scraping_service_config

The `scraping_service` block configures the
[scraping service](./scraping-service.md), an operational
mode where configurations are stored centrally in a KV store and a cluster of
agents distribute discovery and scrape load between nodes.

```yaml
# Whether to enable scraping service mode. When enabled, local configs
# cannot be used.
[enabled: boolean | default = false]

# How often should the agent manually reshard. Useful for if KV change
# events are not sent by an agent.
[reshard_interval: <duration> | default = "1m"]

# The timeout for a reshard. Applies to a cluster-wide reshard (done when
# joining or leaving the cluster) and local reshards (done every
# reshard_interval). A timeout of 0 indicates no timeout.
[reshard_timeout: <duration> | default = "30s"]

# Configuration for the KV store to store metrics
kvstore: <kvstore_config>

# Configuration for how agents will cluster together.
lifecycler: <lifecycler_config>
```

### kvstore_config

The `kvstore_config` block configures the KV store used as storage for
configurations in the scraping service mode.

```yaml
# Which underlying KV store to use. Can be either consul or etcd
[store: <string> | default = ""]

# Key prefix to store all configurations with. Must end in /.
[prefix: <string> | default = "configurations/"]

  # The Dial timeout for the ETCD connection.
  [dial_tmeout: <duration> | default = 10s]

  # The maximum number of retries to do for failed ops to ETCD.
  [max_retries: <int> | default = 10]
```

### lifecycler_config

The `lifecycler_config` block configures the lifecycler; the component that
Agents use to cluster together.

```yaml
# Configures the distributed hash ring storage.
ring:
  # KV store for getting and sending distributed hash ring updates.
  kvstore: <kvstore_config>

  # Specifies when other agents in the clsuter should be considered
  # unhealthy if they haven't sent a heartbeat within this duration.
  [heartbeat_timeout: <duration> | default = "1m"]

# Number of tokens to generate for the distributed hash ring.
[num_tokens: <int> | default = 128]

# How often agents should send a heartbeat to the distributed hash
# ring.
[heartbeat_period: <duration> | default = "5s"]

# How long to wait for tokens from other agents after generating
# a new set to resolve collisions. Useful only when using a gossip
# KV store.
[observe_period: <duration> | default = "0s"]

# Period to wait before joining the ring. 0s means to join immediately.
[join_after: <duration> | default = "0s"]

# Minimum duration to wait before marking the agent as ready to receive
# traffic. Used to work around race conditions for multiple agents exiting
# the distributed hash ring at the same time.
[min_ready_duration: <duration> | default = "1m"]

# Network interfaces to resolve addresses defined by other agents
# registered in distributed hash ring.
[interface_names: <string array> | default = ["eth0", "en0"]]

# Duration to sleep before exiting. Ensures that metrics get scraped
# before the process quits.
[final_sleep: <duration> | default = "30s"]

# File path to store tokens. If empty, tokens will not be stored during
# shutdown and will not be restored at startup.
[tokens_file_path: <string> | default = ""]

# Availability zone of the host the agent is running on. Default is an
# empty string which disables zone awareness for writes.
[availability_zone: <string> | default = ""]
```

### scraping_service_client_config

The `scraping_service_client_config` block configures how clustered Agents will
generate gRPC clients to connect to each other.

```yaml
grpc_client_config:
  # Maximum size in bytes the gRPC client will accept from the connected server.
  [max_recv_msg_size: <int> | default = 104857600]

  # Maximum size in bytes the gRPC client will sent to the connected server.
  [max_send_msg_size: <int> | default = 16777216]

  # Whether messages should be gzipped.
  [use_gzip_compression: <boolean> | default = false]

  # The rate limit for gRPC clients; 0 means no rate limit.
  [rate_limit: <float64> | default = 0]

  # gRPC burst allowed for rate limits.
  [rate_limit_burst: <int> | default = 0]

  # Controls if when a rate limit is hit whether the client should
  # retry the request.
  [backoff_on_ratelimits: <boolean> | default = false]

  # Configures the retry backoff when backoff_on_ratelimits is
  # true.
  backoff_config:
    # The minimum delay when backing off.
    [min_period: <duration> | default = "100ms"]

    # The maximum delay when backing off.
    [max_period: <duration> | default = "10s"]

    # The number of times to backoff and retry before failing.
    [max_retries: <int> | default = 10]
```

### global_config

The `global_config` block configures global values for all launched Prometheus
instanes.

```yaml
# How frequently should Prometheus instances scrape.
[scrape_interval: duration | default = "1m"]

# How long to wait before timing out a scrape from a target.
[scrape_timeout: duration | default = "10s"]

# A list of static labels to add for all metrics.
external_labels:
  { <string>: <string> }
```

### prometheus_instance_config

The `prometheus_instance_config` block configures an individual Prometheus
instance, which acts as its own mini Prometheus agent.

```yaml
# Name of the instance. Must be present. Will be added as a label to agent
# metrics.
name: string

# Whether this agent instance should only scrape from targets running on the
# same machine as the agent process.
[host_filter: <boolean> | default = false]

# Relabel configs to apply against discovered targets. The relabeling is
# temporary and just used for filtering targets.
host_filter_relabel_configs:
  [ - <relabel_config> ... ]

# How frequently the WAL truncation process should run. Every iteration of
# truncation will checkpoint old series, create a new segment for new samples,
# and remove old samples that have been succesfully sent via remote_write.
# If there are are multiple remote_write endpoints, the endpoint with the
# earliest timestamp is used for the cutoff period, ensuring that no data
# gets truncated until all remote_write configurations have been able to
# send the data.
[wal_truncate_frequency: <duration> | default = "1m"]

# The minimum amount of time that series and samples should exist in the WAL
# before being considered for deletion. The consumed disk space of the WAL will
# increase by making this value larger.
#
# Setting this value to 0s is valid, but may delete series before all
# remote_write shards have been able to write all data, and may cause errors on
# slower machines.
[min_wal_time: <duration> | default = "5m"]

# The maximum amount of time that series and samples may exist within the WAL
# before being considered for deletion. Series that have not received writes
# since this period will be removed, and all samples older than this period will
# be removed.
#
# This value is useful in long-running network outages, preventing the WAL from
# growing forever.
#
# Must be larger than min_wal_time.
[max_wal_time: <duration> | default = "4h"]

# Deadline for flushing data when a Prometheus instance shuts down
# before giving up and letting the shutdown proceed.
[remote_flush_deadline: <duration> | default = "1m"]

# When true, writes staleness markers to all active series to
# remote_write.
[write_stale_on_shutdown: <boolean> | default = false]

# A list of scrape configuration rules.
scrape_configs:
  - [<scrape_config>]

# A list of remote_write targets.
remote_write:
  - [<remote_write>]
```

### scrape_config

A `scrape_config` section specifies a set of targets and parameters describing
how to scrape them. In the general case, one scrape configuration specifies a
single job. In advanced configurations, this may change.

Targets may be statically configured via the `static_configs` parameter or
dynamically discovered using one of the supported service-discovery mechanisms.

Additionally, `relabel_configs` allow advanced modifications to any target and
its labels before scraping.

```yaml
# The job name assigned to scraped metrics by default.
job_name: <job_name>

# How frequently to scrape targets from this job.
[ scrape_interval: <duration> | default = <global_config.scrape_interval> ]

# Per-scrape timeout when scraping this job.
[ scrape_timeout: <duration> | default = <global_config.scrape_timeout> ]

# The HTTP resource path on which to fetch metrics from targets.
[ metrics_path: <path> | default = /metrics ]

# honor_labels controls how Prometheus handles conflicts between labels that are
# already present in scraped data and labels that Prometheus would attach
# server-side ("job" and "instance" labels, manually configured target
# labels, and labels generated by service discovery implementations).
#
# If honor_labels is set to "true", label conflicts are resolved by keeping label
# values from the scraped data and ignoring the conflicting server-side labels.
#
# If honor_labels is set to "false", label conflicts are resolved by renaming
# conflicting labels in the scraped data to "exported_<original-label>" (for
# example "exported_instance", "exported_job") and then attaching server-side
# labels.
#
# Setting honor_labels to "true" is useful for use cases such as federation and
# scraping the Pushgateway, where all labels specified in the target should be
# preserved.
#
# Note that any globally configured "external_labels" are unaffected by this
# setting. In communication with external systems, they are always applied only
# when a time series does not have a given label yet and are ignored otherwise.
[ honor_labels: <boolean> | default = false ]

# honor_timestamps controls whether Prometheus respects the timestamps present
# in scraped data.
#
# If honor_timestamps is set to "true", the timestamps of the metrics exposed
# by the target will be used.
#
# If honor_timestamps is set to "false", the timestamps of the metrics exposed
# by the target will be ignored.
[ honor_timestamps: <boolean> | default = true ]

# Configures the protocol scheme used for requests.
[ scheme: <scheme> | default = http ]

# Optional HTTP URL parameters.

```

### digitalocean_sd_config

DigitalOcean SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets from
[DigitalOcean's](https://www.digitalocean.com/) Droplets API. This service
discovery uses the public IPv4 address by default, by that can be changed with
relabelling, as demonstrated in the [Prometheus digitalocean-sd configuration
file](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/release-2.22/documentation/examples/prometheus-digitalocean.yml).

The following meta labels are available on targets during relabeling:

- `__meta_digitalocean_droplet_id`: the id of the droplet

### dockerswarm_sd_config

Docker Swarm SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets from [Docker
Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) engine.

One of the following roles can be configured to discover targets:

#### services

The `services` role discovers all [Swarm
services](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/key-concepts/#services-and-tasks)
and exposes their ports as targets. For each published port of a service, a
single target is generated. If a service has no published ports, a target per
service is created using the port parameter defined in the SD configuration.

Available meta labels:

- `__meta_dockerswarm_service_id`: the id of the service
- `__meta_dockerswarm_service_name`: the name of the service
- `__meta_dockerswarm_service_mode`: the mode of the service
- `__meta_dockerswarm_service_endpoint_port_name`: the name of the endpoint port, if available
- `__meta_dockerswarm_service_endpoint_port_publish_mode`: the publish mode of the endpoint port
- `__meta_dockerswarm_service_label_<labelname>`: each label of the service
- `__meta_dockerswarm_service_task_container_hostname`: the container hostname of the target, if available
- `__meta_dockerswarm_service_task_container_image`: the container image of the target
- `__meta_dockerswarm_service_updating_status`: the status of the service, if available
- `__meta_dockerswarm_network_id`: the ID of the network
- `__meta_dockerswarm_network_name`: the name of the network
- `__meta_dockerswarm_network_ingress`: whether the network is ingress
- `__meta_dockerswarm_network_internal`: whether the network is internal
- `__meta_dockerswarm_network_label_<labelname>`: each label of the network
- `__meta_dockerswarm_network_scope`: the scope of the network

#### tasks

The `tasks` role discovers all [Swarm
tasks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/key-concepts/#services-and-tasks)
and exposes their ports as targets. For each published port of a task, a single
target is generated. If a task has no published ports, a target per task is
created using the `port` parameter defined in the SD configuration.

Available meta labels:

- `__meta_dockerswarm_task_id`: the id of the task
- `__meta_dockerswarm_task_container_id`: the container id of the task
- `__meta_dockerswarm_task_desired_state`: the desired state of the task
- `__meta_dockerswarm_task_label_<labelname>`: each label of the task
- `__meta_dockerswarm_task_slot`: the slot of the task
- `__meta_dockerswarm_task_state`: the state of the task
- `__meta_dockerswarm_task_port_publish_mode`: the publish mode of the task port
- `__meta_dockerswarm_service_id`: the id of the service
- `__meta_dockerswarm_service_name`: the name of the service
- `__meta_dockerswarm_service_mode`: the mode of the service
- `__meta_dockerswarm_service_label_<labelname>`: each label of the service
- `__meta_dockerswarm_network_id`: the ID of the network
- `__meta_dockerswarm_network_name`: the name of the network
- `__meta_dockerswarm_network_ingress`: whether the network is ingress
- `__meta_dockerswarm_network_internal`: whether the network is internal
- `__meta_dockerswarm_network_label_<labelname>`: each label of the network

### dns_sd_config

A DNS-based service discovery configuration allows specifying a set of DNS
domain names which are periodically queried to discover a list of targets. The
DNS servers to be contacted are read from `/etc/resolv.conf`.

This service discovery method only supports basic DNS A, AAAA and SRV record
queries, but not the advanced DNS-SD approach specified in RFC6763.

During the relabeling phase, the meta label `__meta_dns_name` is available on
each target and is set to the record name that produced the discovered target.

```yaml
# A list of DNS domain names to be queried.
names:
  [ - <domain_name> ]

# The type of DNS query to perform.
[ type: <query_type> | default = 'SRV' ]

# The port number used if the query type is not SRV.
[ port: <number>]

# The time after which the provided names are refreshed.
[ refresh_interval: <duration> | default = 30s ]
```

### ec2_sd_config

EC2 SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets from AWS EC2 instances.
The private IP address is used by default, but may be changed to the public IP
address with relabeling.

The following meta labels are available on targets during relabeling:

* `__meta_ec2_availability_zone`: the availability zone in which the instance is running
* `__meta_ec2_instance_id`: the EC2 instance ID
* `__meta_ec2_instance_state`: the state of the EC2 instance
* `__meta_ec2_instance_type`: the type of the EC2 instance
* `__meta_ec2_owner_id`: the ID of the AWS account that owns the EC2 instance
* `__meta_ec2_platform`: the Operating System platform, set to 'windows' on Windows servers, absent otherwise
* `__meta_ec2_primary_subnet_id`: the subnet ID of the primary network interface, if available
* `__meta_ec2_private_dns_name`: the private DNS name of the instance, if available
* `__meta_ec2_private_ip`: the private IP address of the instance, if present
* `__meta_ec2_public_dns_name`: the public DNS name of the instance, if available
* `__meta_ec2_public_ip`: the public IP address of the instance, if available

### openstack_sd_config

OpenStack SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets from OpenStack Nova
instances.

One of the following `<openstack_role>` types can be configured to discover
targets:

#### hypervisor

The hypervisor role discovers one target per Nova hypervisor node. The target
address defaults to the host_ip attribute of the hypervisor.

The following meta labels are available on targets during relabeling:

* `__meta_openstack_hypervisor_host_ip`: the hypervisor node's IP address.

* `__meta_openstack_tag_<tagkey>`: each tag value of the instance.
* `__meta_openstack_user_id`: the user account owning the tenant.

See below for the configuration options for OpenStack discovery:

```yaml
# The information to access the OpenStack API.

# The OpenStack role of entities that should be discovered.
role: <openstack_role>

# The OpenStack Region.
region: <string>

# identity_endpoint specifies the HTTP endpoint that is required to work with
# the Identity API of the appropriate version. While it's ultimately needed by
# all of the identity services, it will often be populated by a provider-level
# function.
[ identity_endpoint: <string> ]

# username is required if using Identity V2 API. Consult with your provider's
# control panel to discover your account's username. In Identity V3, either
# userid or a combination of username and domain_id or domain_name are needed.
[ username: <string> ]
[ userid: <string> ]

# password for the Identity V2 and V3 APIs. Consult with your provider's
# control panel to discover your account's preferred method of authentication.
[ password: <secret> ]

# At most one of domain_id and domain_name must be provided if using username
# with Identity V3. Otherwise, either are optional.
[ domain_name: <string> ]
[ domain_id: <string> ]

# The project_id and project_name fields are optional for the Identity V2 API.
# Some providers allow you to specify a project_name instead of the project_id.
# Some require both. Your provider's authentication policies will determine
# how these fields influence authentication.
[ project_name: <string> ]
[ project_id: <string> ]

# The application_credential_id or application_credential_name fields are
# required if using an application credential to authenticate. Some providers
# allow you to create an application credential to authenticate rather than a
# password.
[ application_credential_name: <string> ]
[ application_credential_id: <string> ]

# The application_credential_secret field is required if using an application
# credential to authenticate.
[ application_credential_secret: <secret> ]

# Whether the service discovery should list all instances for all projects.
# It is only relevant for the 'instance' role and usually requires admin permissions.
[ all_tenants: <boolean> | default: false ]

# Refresh interval to re-read the instance list.
[ refresh_interval: <duration> | default = 60s ]

# The port to scrape metrics from. If using the public IP address, this must
# instead be specified in the relabeling rule.
[ port: <int> | default = 80 ]

# TLS configuration.
tls_config:
  [ <tls_config> ]
```

### tls_config

A `tls_config` allows configuring TLS connections.

```yaml
# CA certificate to validate API server certificate with.
[ ca_file: <filename> ]

# Certificate and key files for client cert authentication to the server.
[ cert_file: <filename> ]
[ key_file: <filename> ]

# ServerName extension to indicate the name of the server.
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4366#section-3.1
[ server_name: <string> ]

# Disable validation of the server certificate.
[ insecure_skip_verify: <boolean> ]
```

### file_sd_config

File-based service discovery provides a more generic way to configure static
targets and serves as an interface to plug in custom service discovery
mechanisms.

It reads a set of files containing a list of zero or more `<static_config>`s.
Changes to all defined files are detected via disk watches and applied
immediately. Files may be provided in YAML or JSON format. Only changes
resulting in well-formed target groups are applied.

The JSON file must contain a list of static configs, using this format:

```json
[
  {
    "targets": [ "<host>", ... ],
    "labels": {
      "<labelname>": "<labelvalue>", ...
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

As a fallback, the file contents are also re-read periodically at the specified
refresh interval.

Each target has a meta label `__meta_filepath` during the relabeling phase. Its
value is set to the filepath from which the target was extracted.

There is a list of
[integrations](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#file-service-discovery)
with this discovery mechanism.

```yaml
# Patterns for files from which target groups are extracted.
files:
  [ - <filename_pattern> ... ]

# Refresh interval to re-read the files.
[ refresh_interval: <duration> | default = 5m ]
```

Where `<filename_pattern>` may be a path ending in `.json`, `.yml` or `.yaml`. The
last path segment may contain a single `*` that matches any character sequence,
e.g. `my/path/tg_*.json`.

### gce_sd_config

GCE SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets from GCP GCE instances.
The private IP address is used by default, but may be changed to the public IP
address with relabeling.

The following meta labels are available on targets during relabeling:

* `__meta_gce_instance_id`: the numeric id of the instance
* `__meta_gce_instance_name`: the name of the instance
* `__meta_gce_label_<name>`: each GCE label of the instance
* `__meta_gce_machine_type`: full or partial URL of the machine type of the instance
* `__meta_gce_metadata_<name>`: each metadata item of the instance
* `__meta_gce_network`: the network URL of the instance
* `__meta_gce_private_ip`: the private IP address of the instance
* `__meta_gce_project`: the GCP project in which the instance is running
* `__meta_gce_public_ip`: the public IP address of the instance, if present
* `__meta_gce_subnetwork`: the subnetwork URL of the instance
* `__meta_gce_tags`: comma separated list of instance tags
* `__meta_gce_zone`: the GCE zone URL in which the instance is running

See below for the configuration options for GCE discovery:

```yaml
# The information to access the GCE API.

# The GCP Project
project: <string>

# The zone of the scrape targets. If you need multiple zones use multiple
# gce_sd_configs.
zone: <string>

# Filter can be used optionally to filter the instance list by other criteria
# Syntax of this filter string is described here in the filter query parameter section:
# https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/instances/list
[ filter: <string> ]

# Refresh interval to re-read the instance list
[ refresh_interval: <duration> | default = 60s ]

# The port to scrape metrics from. If using the public IP address, this must
# instead be specified in the relabeling rule.
[ port: <int> | default = 80 ]

# The tag separator is used to separate the tags on concatenation
[ tag_separator: <string> | default = , ]
```

Credentials are discovered by the Google Cloud SDK default client by looking in the following places, preferring the first location found:

1. a JSON file specified by the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment
   variable
2. a JSON file in the well-known path
   `$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`
3. fetched from the GCE metadata server

If Prometheus is running within GCE, the service account associated with the
instance it is running on should have at least read-only permissions to the
compute resources. If running outside of GCE make sure to create an appropriate
service account and place the credential file in one of the expected locations.

### hetzner_sd_config

Hetzner SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets from [Hetzner
Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/) API and
[Robot](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/) API. This service discovery uses the
public IPv4 address by default, but that can be changed with relabeling, as
demonstrated in the [Prometheus hetzner-sd configuration
file](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/release-2.22/documentation/examples/prometheus-hetzner.yml).

The following meta labels are available on all targets during relabeling:

- `__meta_hetzner_server_id`: the ID of the server
- `__meta_hetzner_server_name`: the name of the server
- `__meta_hetzner_server_status`: the status of the server
- `__meta_hetzner_public_ipv4`: the public ipv4 address of the server

# The time after which the servers are refreshed.
[ refresh_interval: <duration> | default = 60s ]
```

### kubernetes_sd_config

Kubernetes SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets from Kubernetes'
REST API and always staying synchronized with the cluster state.

One of the following role types can be configured to discover targets:

#### node

The `node` role discovers one target per cluster node with the address defaulting
to the Kubelet's HTTP port. The target address defaults to the first existing
address of the Kubernetes node object in the address type order of
`NodeInternalIP`, `NodeExternalIP`, `NodeLegacyHostIP`, and `NodeHostName`.

Available meta labels:

* `__meta_kubernetes_node_name`: The name of the node object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_node_label_<labelname>`: Each label from the node object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_node_labelpresent_<labelname>`: true for each label from the node object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_node_annotation_<annotationname>`: Each annotation from the node object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_node_annotationpresent_<annotationname>`: true for each annotation from the node object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_node_address_<address_type>`: The first address for each node address type, if it exists.

In addition, the `instance` label for the node will be set to the node name as
retrieved from the API server.

#### service

The `service` role discovers a target for each service port for each service. This
is generally useful for blackbox monitoring of a service. The address will be
set to the Kubernetes DNS name of the service and respective service port.

Available meta labels:

* `__meta_kubernetes_namespace`: The namespace of the service object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_service_annotation_<annotationname>`: Each annotation from the service object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_service_annotationpresent_<annotationname>`: "true" for each annotation of the service object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_service_cluster_ip`: The cluster IP address of the service. (Does not apply to services of type ExternalName)
* `__meta_kubernetes_service_external_name`: The DNS name of the service. (Applies to services of type ExternalName)

each declared port of a container, a single target is generated. If a container
has no specified ports, a port-free target per container is created for manually
adding a port via relabeling.

Available meta labels:

* `__meta_kubernetes_namespace`: The namespace of the pod object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_name`: The name of the pod object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_ip`: The pod IP of the pod object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_<labelname>`: Each label from the pod object.

* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_<annotationname>`: Each annotation from the pod object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotationpresent_<annotationname>`: true for each annotation from the pod object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_init`: true if the container is an InitContainer
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_name`: Name of the container the target address points to.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_name`: Name of the container port.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_number`: Number of the container port.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_protocol`: Protocol of the container port.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_ready`: Set to true or false for the pod's ready state.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_phase`: Set to Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed or Unknown in the lifecycle.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_node_name`: The name of the node the pod is scheduled onto.

* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_uid`: The UID of the pod object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_controller_kind`: Object kind of the pod controller.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_controller_name`: Name of the pod controller.

#### endpoints

The `endpoints` role discovers targets from listed endpoints of a service. For
each endpoint address one target is discovered per port. If the endpoint is
backed by a pod, all additional container ports of the pod, not bound to an
endpoint port, are discovered as targets as well.

Available meta labels:

* `__meta_kubernetes_namespace`: The namespace of the endpoints object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_endpoints_name`: The names of the endpoints object.
* For all targets discovered directly from the endpoints list (those not
  additionally inferred from underlying pods), the following labels are
  attached:
  * `__meta_kubernetes_endpoint_hostname`: Hostname of the endpoint.
  * `__meta_kubernetes_endpoint_node_name`: Name of the node hosting the endpoint.

  * `__meta_kubernetes_endpoint_port_protocol`: Protocol of the endpoint port.
  * `__meta_kubernetes_endpoint_address_target_kind`: Kind of the endpoint address target.
  * `__meta_kubernetes_endpoint_address_target_name`: Name of the endpoint address target.
* If the endpoints belong to a service, all labels of the `role: service`
  discovery are attached.
* For all targets backed by a pod, all labels of the role: `pod discovery` are
  attached.

#### ingress

The `ingress` role discovers a target for each path of each ingress. This is
generally useful for blackbox monitoring of an ingress. The address will be set
to the host specified in the ingress spec.

Available meta labels:

* `__meta_kubernetes_namespace`: The namespace of the ingress object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_name`: The name of the ingress object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_label_<labelname>`: Each label from the ingress object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_labelpresent_<labelname>`: true for each label from the ingress object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_annotation_<annotationname>`: Each annotation from the ingress object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_annotationpresent_<annotationname>`: true for each annotation from the ingress object.
* `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_scheme`: Protocol scheme of ingress, `https` if TLS config is set. Defaults to `http`.
* `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_path`: Path from ingress spec. Defaults to /.

See below for the configuration options for Kubernetes discovery:

```yaml
# The information to access the Kubernetes API.

# The API server addresses. If left empty, Prometheus is assumed to run inside
# of the cluster and will discover API servers automatically and use the pod's
# CA certificate and bearer token file at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/.
[ api_server: <host> ]

# The Kubernetes role of entities that should be discovered.
role: <role>

# Optional authentication information used to authenticate to the API server.
# Note that `basic_auth`, `bearer_token` and `bearer_token_file` options are
# mutually exclusive.
# password and password_file are mutually exclusive.

# Optional HTTP basic authentication information.
basic_auth:
  [ username: <string> ]
  [ password: <secret> ]
  [ password_file: <string> ]

# Optional bearer token authentication information.
[ bearer_token: <secret> ]

# Optional bearer token file authentication information.
[ bearer_token_file: <filename> ]

# Optional proxy URL.
[ proxy_url: <string> ]

# TLS configuration.
tls_config:
  [ <tls_config> ]

# Optional namespace discovery. If omitted, all namespaces are used.
namespaces:
  names:
    [ - <string> ]
```

Where `<role>` must be `endpoints`, `service`, `pod`, `node`, or `ingress`.

### marathon_sd_config

Marathon SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets using the Marathon
REST API. Prometheus will periodically check the REST endpoint for currently
running tasks and create a target group for every app that has at least one
healthy task.

The following meta labels are available on targets during relabeling:

* `__meta_marathon_app`: the name of the app (with slashes replaced by dashes)

  [ password_file: <string> ]

# Sets the `Authorization` header on every request with
# the configured bearer token. It is mutually exclusive with `bearer_token_file` and other authentication mechanisms.
# NOTE: The current version of DC/OS marathon (v1.11.0) does not support standard Bearer token authentication. Use `auth_token` instead.
[ bearer_token: <string> ]

# Sets the `Authorization` header on every request with the bearer token
# read from the configured file. It is mutually exclusive with `bearer_token` and other authentication mechanisms.
# NOTE: The current version of DC/OS marathon (v1.11.0) does not support standard Bearer token authentication. Use `auth_token_file` instead.

# TLS configuration for connecting to marathon servers
tls_config:
  [ <tls_config> ]

# Optional proxy URL.
[ proxy_url: <string> ]
```

By default every app listed in Marathon will be scraped by Prometheus. If not
all of your services provide Prometheus metrics, you can use a Marathon label
and Prometheus relabeling to control which instances will actually be scraped.

By default, all apps will show up as a single job in Prometheus (the one
specified in the configuration file), which can also be changed using
relabeling.

### nerve_sd_config

Nerve SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets from AirBnB's Nerve
which are stored in Zookeeper.

The following meta labels are available on targets during relabeling:

* `__meta_nerve_path`: the full path to the endpoint node in Zookeeper
* `__meta_nerve_endpoint_host`: the host of the endpoint
* `__meta_nerve_endpoint_port`: the port of the endpoint
* `__meta_nerve_endpoint_name`: the name of the endpoint

```yaml
# The Zookeeper servers.
servers:
  - <host>
# Paths can point to a single service, or the root of a tree of services.
paths:
  - <string>
[ timeout: <duration> | default = 10s ]
```

### serverset_sd_config

Serverset SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets from Serversets
which are stored in Zookeeper. Serversets are commonly used by Finagle and
Aurora.

The following meta labels are available on targets during relabeling:

* `__meta_serverset_path`: the full path to the serverset member node in Zookeeper
* `__meta_serverset_endpoint_host`: the host of the default endpoint
* `__meta_serverset_endpoint_port`: the port of the default endpoint
* `__meta_serverset_endpoint_host_<endpoint>`: the host of the given endpoint
* `__meta_serverset_endpoint_port_<endpoint>`: the port of the given endpoint
* `__meta_serverset_shard`: the shard number of the member
* `__meta_serverset_status`: the status of the member

```yaml
# The Zookeeper servers.
servers:

paths:
  - <string>
[ timeout: <duration> | default = 10s ]
```

### triton_sd_config

Triton SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets from Container Monitor
discovery endpoints.

The following meta labels are available on targets during relabeling:

* `__meta_triton_groups`: the list of groups belonging to the target joined by a comma separator
* `__meta_triton_machine_alias`: the alias of the target container
* `__meta_triton_machine_brand`: the brand of the target container
* `__meta_triton_machine_id`: the UUID of the target container
* `__meta_triton_machine_image`: the target containers image type
* `__meta_triton_server_id`: the server UUID for the target container

```yaml
# The information to access the Triton discovery API.

# The account to use for discovering new target containers.
account: <string>

# The DNS suffix which should be applied to target containers.
dns_suffix: <string>

# The Triton discovery endpoint (e.g. 'cmon.us-east-3b.triton.zone'). This is
# often the same value as dns_suffix.
endpoint: <string>

# A list of groups for which targets are retrieved. If omitted, all containers
# available to the requesting account are scraped.
groups:
  [ - <string> ... ]

# The interval which should be used for refreshing target containers.
[ refresh_interval: <duration> | default = 60s ]

# The Triton discovery API version.
[ version: <int> | default = 1 ]

# TLS configuration.
tls_config:
  [ <tls_config> ]
```

### eureka_sd_config

Eureka SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets using the
[Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) REST API. Prometheus will
periodically check the REST endpoint and create a target for every app instance.

The following meta labels are available on targets during relabeling:

- `__meta_eureka_app_name`: the name of the app
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_id`: the ID of the app instance
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_hostname`: the hostname of the instance
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_homepage_url`: the homepage url of the app instance
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_statuspage_url`: the status page url of the app instance
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_healthcheck_url`: the health check url of the app instance
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_ip_addr`: the IP address of the app instance
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_vip_address`: the VIP address of the app instance
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_secure_vip_address`: the secure VIP address of the app instance

- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_port`: the port of the app instance
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_port_enabled`: the port enabled of the app instance
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_secure_port`: the secure port address of the app instance
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_secure_port_enabled`: the secure port of the app instance
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_country_id`: the country ID of the app instance
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_metadata_<metadataname>`: app instance metadata
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_datacenterinfo_name`: the datacenter name of the app instance
- `__meta_eureka_app_instance_datacenterinfo_<metadataname>`: the datacenter metadata

See below for the configuration options for Eureka discovery:

```yaml
# The URL to connect to the Eureka server.
server: <string>

# Sets the `Authorization` header on every request with the
# configured username and password.
# password and password_file are mutually exclusive.
basic_auth:
  [ username: <string> ]
  [ password: <secret> ]
  [ password_file: <string> ]

# Sets the `Authorization` header on every request with
# the configured bearer token. It is mutually exclusive with `bearer_token_file`.
[ bearer_token: <string> ]

# Sets the `Authorization` header on every request with the bearer token
# read from the configured file. It is mutually exclusive with `bearer_token`.
[ bearer_token_file: <filename> ]

# Configures the scrape request's TLS settings.
tls_config:
  [ <tls_config> ]

# Optional proxy URL.
[ proxy_url: <string> ]

# Refresh interval to re-read the app instance list.
[ refresh_interval: <duration> | default = 30s ]
```

See [the Prometheus eureka-sd configuration
file](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/release-2.22/documentation/examples/prometheus-eureka.yml)
for a practical example on how to set up your Eureka app and your Prometheus
configuration.

### static_config

A `static_config` allows specifying a list of targets and a common label set for
them. It is the canonical way to specify static targets in a scrape
configuration.

```yaml
# The targets specified by the static config.
targets:
  [ - '<host>' ]

# Labels assigned to all metrics scraped from the targets.
labels:
  [ <labelname>: <labelvalue> ... ]
```

### relabel_config

Relabeling is a powerful tool to dynamically rewrite the label set of a target
before it gets scraped. Multiple relabeling steps can be configured per scrape
configuration. They are applied to the label set of each target in order of
their appearance in the configuration file.

Initially, aside from the configured per-target labels, a target's job label is
set to the `job_name` value of the respective scrape configuration. The
__address__ label is set to the `<host>:<port>` address of the target. After
relabeling, the `instance` label is set to the value of `__address__` by default if
it was not set during relabeling. The `__scheme__` and `__metrics_path__` labels are
set to the scheme and metrics path of the target respectively. The
`__param_<name>` label is set to the value of the first passed URL parameter
called `<name>`.

Additional labels prefixed with `__meta_` may be available during the relabeling
phase. They are set by the service discovery mechanism that provided the target
and vary between mechanisms.

Labels starting with `__` will be removed from the label set after target
relabeling is completed.

If a relabeling step needs to store a label value only temporarily (as the input
to a subsequent relabeling step), use the `__tmp` label name prefix. This prefix
is guaranteed to never be used by Prometheus itself.

```yaml
# The source labels select values from existing labels. Their content is concatenated
# using the configured separator and matched against the configured regular expression
# for the replace, keep, and drop actions.
[ source_labels: '[' <labelname> [, ...] ']' ]

# Separator placed between concatenated source label values.
[ separator: <string> | default = ; ]

# Label to which the resulting value is written in a replace action.
# It is mandatory for replace actions. Regex capture groups are available.
[ target_label: <labelname> ]

# Regular expression against which the extracted value is matched.
[ regex: <regex> | default = (.*) ]

# Modulus to take of the hash of the source label values.
[ modulus: <uint64> ]

# Replacement value against which a regex replace is performed if the
# regular expression matches. Regex capture groups are available.
[ replacement: <string> | default = $1 ]

# Action to perform based on regex matching.
[ action: <relabel_action> | default = replace ]
```

`<regex>` is any valid RE2 regular expression. It is required for the `replace`,
`keep`, `drop`, `labelmap`, `labeldrop` and `labelkeep` actions. The regex is
anchored on both ends. To un-anchor the regex, use `.*<regex>.*`.

`<relabel_action>` determines the relabeling action to take:

* `replace`: Match regex against the concatenated source_labels. Then, set
  target_label to replacement, with match group references (${1}, ${2}, ...) in
  replacement substituted by their value. If regex does not match, no
  replacement takes place.
* `keep`: Drop targets for which regex does not match the concatenated
  source_labels.
* `drop`: Drop targets for which regex matches the concatenated source_labels.
* `hashmod`: Set target_label to the modulus of a hash of the concatenated
  source_labels.
* `labelmap`: Match regex against all label names. Then copy the values of the
  matching labels to label names given by replacement with match group
  references (${1}, ${2}, ...) in replacement substituted by their value.
* `labeldrop`: Match regex against all label names. Any label that matches will
  be removed from the set of labels.
* `labelkeep`: Match regex against all label names. Any label that does not
  match will be removed from the set of labels.

Care must be taken with `labeldrop` and `labelkeep` to ensure that metrics are still uniquely labeled once the labels are removed.

### remote_write

`write_relabel_configs` is relabeling applied to samples before sending them to
the remote endpoint. Write relabeling is applied after external labels. This
could be used to limit which samples are sent.

```yaml
# The URL of the endpoint to send samples to.
url: <string>

# Timeout for requests to the remote write endpoint.
[ remote_timeout: <duration> | default = 30s ]

# List of remote write relabel configurations.
write_relabel_configs:
  [ - <relabel_config> ... ]

# Sets the `Authorization` header on every remote write request with the
# configured username and password.
# password and password_file are mutually exclusive.
basic_auth:
  [ username: <string> ]
  [ password: <string> ]
  [ password_file: <string> ]

# Sets the `Authorization` header on every remote write request with
# the configured bearer token. It is mutually exclusive with `bearer_token_file`.
[ bearer_token: <string> ]

# Sets the `Authorization` header on every remote write request with the bearer token
# read from the configured file. It is mutually exclusive with `bearer_token`.
[ bearer_token_file: /path/to/bearer/token/file ]

# Configures the remote write request's TLS settings.
tls_config:
  [ <tls_config> ]

# Optional proxy URL.
[ proxy_url: <string> ]

# Configures the queue used to write to remote storage.
queue_config:

  # samples from the WAL. It is recommended to have enough capacity in each
  # shard to buffer several requests to keep throughput up while processing
  # occasional slow remote requests.
  [ capacity: <int> | default = 500 ]
  # Maximum number of shards, i.e. amount of concurrency.
  [ max_shards: <int> | default = 1000 ]
  # Minimum number of shards, i.e. amount of concurrency.
  [ min_shards: <int> | default = 1 ]
  # Maximum number of samples per send.
  [ max_samples_per_send: <int> | default = 100]
  # Maximum time a sample will wait in buffer.
  [ batch_send_deadline: <duration> | default = 5s ]
  # Initial retry delay. Gets doubled for every retry.
  [ min_backoff: <duration> | default = 30ms ]
  # Maximum retry delay.
  [ max_backoff: <duration> | default = 100ms ]

# Configures the sending of series metadata to remote storage.
# It is experimental and subject to change at any point.
metadata_config:
  # Whether metric metadata is sent to remote storage or not.
  [ send: <boolean> | default = true ]
  # How frequently metric metadata is sent to remote storage.
  [ send_interval: <duration> | default = 1m ]
```

### loki_config

The `loki_config` block configures how the Agent collects logs and sends them to a Loki push API endpoint. `loki_config` is identical to how Promtail is configured, except deprecated
fields have been removed and the server_config is not supported.

Please refer to the
[Promtail documentation](https://github.com/grafana/loki/tree/master/docs/sources/clients/promtail#client_config)
for the supported values for these fields.

```yaml
clients:
  - [<promtail.client_config>]

[positions: <promtail.position_config>]

scrape_configs:
  - [<promtail.scrape_config>]

[target_config: <promtail.target_config>]
```

### tempo_config

The `tempo_config` block configures how the Agent receives traces and sends them to Tempo.

```yaml
# Attributes options: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/1962d7cd2b371129394b0242b120835e44840192/processor/attributesprocessor

```

### integrations_config

The `integrations_config` block configures how the Agent runs integrations that
scrape and send metrics without needing to run specific Prometheus exporters or
manually write `scrape_configs`:

```yaml
# Controls the Agent integration
agent:
  # Enables the Agent integration, allowing the Agent to automatically
  # collect and send metrics about itself.
  [enabled: <boolean> | default = false]

  # Automatically collect metrics from this integration. If disabled,
  # the agent integration will be run but not scraped and thus not
  # remote_written. Metrics for the integration will be exposed at
  # /integrations/agent/metrics and can be scraped by an external process.
  [scrape_integration: <boolean> | default = <integrations_config.scrape_integrations>]

  # How often should the metrics be collected? Defaults to
  # prometheus.global.scrape_interval.
  [scrape_interval: <duration> | default = <global_config.scrape_interval>]

  # The timtout before considering the scrape a failure. Defaults to
  # prometheus.global.scrape_timeout.
  [scrape_timeout: <duration> | default = <global_config.scrape_timeout>]

  # Allows for relabeling labels on the target.
  relabel_configs:
    [- <relabel_config> ... ]

  # Relabel metrics coming from the integration, allowing to drop series
  # from the integration that you don't care about.
  metric_relabel_configs:
    [ - <relabel_config> ... ]

# Controls the node_exporter integration
node_exporter: <node_exporter_config>

# Controls the process_exporter integration
process_exporter: <process_exporter_config>

# Controls the mysqld_exporter integration
mysqld_exporter: <mysqld_exporter_config>

# Controls the redis_exporter integration
redis_exporter: <redis_exporter_config>

# Controls the dnsmasq_exporter integration
dnsmasq_exporter: <dnsmasq_exporter_config>

# Controls the memcached_exporter integration
memcached_exporter: <memcached_exporter_config>

# Controls the postgres_exporter integration
postgres_exporter: <postgres_exporter_config>

# Controls the statsd_exporter integration
statsd_exporter: <statsd_exporter_config>

# Controls the consul_exporter integration
consul_exporter: <consul_exporter_config>

# Automatically collect metrics from enabled integrations. If disabled,
# integrations will be run but not scraped and thus not remote_written. Metrics
# for integrations will be exposed at /integrations/<integration_key>/metrics
# and can be scraped by an external process.
[scrape_integrations: <boolean> | default = true]

# When true, replaces the instance label with the hostname of the machine,
# rather than 127.0.0.1:<server.http_listen_port>. Useful when running multiple
# Agents with the same integrations and uniquely identifying where metrics are
# coming from.
#
# The value for the instance label can be replaced by providing custom
# relabel_configs for an integration. The overwritten instance label will be
# available when relabel_configs run.
[replace_instance_label: <boolean> | default = true]

# When true, adds an agent_hostname label to all samples coming from
# integrations. The value of the agent_hostname label will be the
# value of $HOSTNAME (if available) or the machine's hostname.
#
# DEPRECATED. May be removed in a future version. Rely on
# replace_instance_label instead, since it has better compatability
# with existing dashboards.
[use_hostname_label: <boolean> | default = true]

# Extra labels to add to all samples coming from integrations.
labels:
  { <string>: <string> }

# The period to wait before restarting an integration that exits with an
# error.
[integration_restart_backoff: <duration> | default = "5s"]

# A list of remote_write targets. Samples coming from integrations will be
# sent to all addresses specified here.
prometheus_remote_write:
  - [<remote_write>]
```

### node_exporter_config

The `node_exporter_config` block configures the `node_exporter` integration,
which is an embedded version of
[`node_exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)
and allows for collecting metrics from the UNIX system that `node_exporter` is
running on. It provides a significant amount of collectors that are responsible
for monitoring various aspects of the host system.

Note that if running the Agent in a container, you will need to bind mount
folders from the host system so the integration can monitor them. You can use
the example below, making sure to replace `/path/to/config.yaml` with a path on
your host machine where an Agent configuration file is:

```
docker run \
  --net="host" \
  --pid="host" \
  --cap-add=SYS_TIME \
  -v "/:/host/root:ro,rslave" \
  -v "/sys:/host/sys:ro,rslave" \
  -v "/proc:/host/proc:ro,rslave" \
  -v /tmp/agent:/etc/agent \
  -v /path/to/config.yaml:/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml \
  grafana/agent:v0.8.0 \
  --config.file=/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml
```

Use this configuration file for testing out `node_exporter` support, replacing
the `prometheus_remote_write` settings with settings appropriate for you:

```yaml
server:
  log_level: info
  http_listen_port: 12345

prometheus:
  wal_directory: /tmp/agent
  global:
    scrape_interval: 15s

integrations:
  node_exporter:
    enabled: true
    rootfs_path: /host/root
    sysfs_path: /host/sys
    procfs_path: /host/proc
  prometheus_remote_write:
    - url: https://prometheus-us-central1.grafana.net/api/prom/push
      basic_auth:
        username: user-id
        password: api-token
```

For running on Kubernetes, ensure to set the equivalent mounts and capabilities
there as well:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: agent
spec:
  containers:
  - image: grafana/agent:v0.8.0
    name: agent
    args:
    - --config.file=/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["SYS_TIME"]
      priviliged: true
      runAsUser: 0
    volumeMounts:
    - name: rootfs
      mountPath: /host/root
      readOnly: true
    - name: sysfs
      mountPath: /host/sys
      readOnly: true
    - name: procfs
      mountPath: /host/proc
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: rootfs
    hostPath:
      path: /
  - name: sysfs
    hostPath:
      path: /sys
  - name: procfs
    hostPath:
      path: /proc
```

The manifest and Tanka configs provided by this repository do not have the
mounts or capabilities required for running this integration.

Some collectors only work on specific operating systems, documented in the
table below. Enabling a collector that is not supported by the operating system
the Agent is running on is a no-op.

### process_exporter_config

The `process_exporter_config` block configures the `process_exporter` integration,
which is an embedded version of
[`process-exporter`](https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter)
and allows for collection metrics based on the /proc filesystem on Linux
systems. Note that on non-Linux systems, enabling this exporter is a no-op.

Note that if running the Agent in a container, you will need to bind mount
folders from the host system so the integration can monitor them:

```
docker run \
  -v "/proc:/proc:ro" \
  -v /tmp/agent:/etc/agent \
  -v /path/to/config.yaml:/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml \
  grafana/agent:v0.8.0 \
  --config.file=/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml
```

Replace `/path/to/config.yaml` with the appropriate path on your host system
where an Agent config file can be found.

For running on Kubernetes, ensure to set the equivalent mounts and capabilities
there as well:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: agent
spec:
  containers:
  - image: grafana/agent:v0.8.0
    name: agent
    args:
    - --config.file=/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml
    volumeMounts:
    - name: procfs
      mountPath: /proc
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: procfs
    hostPath:
      path: /proc
```

The manifest and Tanka configs provided by this repository do not have the
mounts or capabilities required for running this integration.

An example config for `process_exporter_config` that tracks all processes is the
following:

```
enabled: true
process_names:
- name: "{{.Comm}}"
  cmdline:
  - '.+'
```

#
# The following template variables are available:

# - {{.Username}}:  Username of the effective user
# - {{.Matches}}:   Map containing all regex capture groups resulting from
#                   matching a process with the cmdline rule group.
# - {{.PID}}:       PID of the process. Note that the PID is copied from the
#                   first executable found.
# - {{.StartTime}}: The start time of the process. This is useful when combined
#                   with PID as PIDS get reused over time.
[name: <string> | default = "{{.ExeBase}}"]

# A list of strings that match the base executable name for a process, truncated

# /proc/<pid>/stat minus the parens.
#
# If any of the strings match, the process will be tracked.
comm:
  [- <string>]

# A list of strings that match argv[0] for a process. If there are no slashes,
# only the basename of argv[0] needs to match. Otherwise the name must be an
# exact match. For example, "postgres" may match any postgres binary but
# "/usr/local/bin/postgres" can only match a postgres at that path exactly.
#
# If any of the strings match, the process will be tracked.
exe:
  [- <string>]

# A list of regular expressions applied to the argv of the process. Each
# regex here must match the corresponding argv for the process to be tracked.
# The first element that is matched is argv[1].

### mysqld_exporter_config

The `mysqld_exporter_config` block configures the `mysqld_exporter` integration,
which is an embedded version of
[`mysqld_exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter)
and allows for collection metrics from MySQL servers.

Note that currently, an Agent can only collect metrics from a single MySQL
server. If you want to collect metrics from multiple servers, run multiple
Agents and add labels using `relabel_configs` to differentiate between the MySQL
servers:

```yaml
mysqld_exporter:
  enabled: true
  data_source_name: root@(server-a:3306)/
  relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__address__]
    target_label: instance

### dnsmasq_exporter_config

The `dnsmasq_exporter_config` block configures the `dnsmasq_exporter` integration,
which is an embedded version of
[`dnsmasq_exporter`](https://github.com/google/dnsmasq_exporter). This allows for
the collection of metrics from dnsmasq servers.

Note that currently, an Agent can only collect metrics from a single dnsmasq
server. If you want to collect metrics from multiple servers, you can run
multiple Agents and add labels using `relabel_configs` to differentiate between
the servers:

```yaml
dnsmasq_exporter:
  enabled: true
  dnsmasq_address: dnsmasq-a:53
  relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__address__]
    target_label: instance
    replacement: dnsmasq-a
```
