# Updating OpenTelemetry Collector dependencies

The Agent depends on various OpenTelemetry (Otel) modules such as these:
```
github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/exporter/jaegerexporter
github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/extension/sigv4authextension
go.opentelemetry.io/collector
go.opentelemetry.io/collector/component
go.opentelemetry.io/otel
go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric
go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk
```

The dependencies mostly come from these repositories:

* [opentelemetry-collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector)
* [opentelemetry-collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib)
* [opentelemetry-go](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go)

Unfortunately, updating Otel dependencies is not straightforward:

* Some of the modules in `opentelemetry-collector` come from a [grafana/opentelemetry-collector](https://github.com/grafana/opentelemetry-collector) fork. 
  * This is mostly so that we can include metrics of Collector components with the metrics shown under the Agent's `/metrics` endpoint.
* All Collector and Collector-Contrib dependencies should be updated at the same time, because they 
  are kept in sync on the same version.
  * E.g. if we use `v0.85.0` of `go.opentelemetry.io/collector`, we also use `v0.85.0` of `spanmetricsconnector`.
  * This is in line with how the Collector itself imports dependencies.
  * It helps us avoid bugs.
  * It makes it easier to communicate to customers the version of Collector which we use in the Agent.
  * Unfortunately, updating everything at once makes it tedious to check if any of our docs or code need updating due to changes in Collector components. A lot of these checks are manual - for example, cross checking the Otel config and Otel documentation between versions.
  * There are some exceptions for modules which don't follow the same versioning. For example, `collector/pdata` is usually on a different version, like `v1.0.0-rcv0013`.

## Updating walkthrough

### Update the Grafana fork of Otel Collector

1. Create a new release branch from the [opentelemetry release branch](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) with a `-grafana` suffix under [grafana/opentelemetry-collector](https://github.com/grafana/opentelemetry-collector). For example, if porting branch `v0.86.0`, make a branch under the fork repo called `0.86-grafana`.
2. Check which branch of the fork repo the Agent currently uses.
3. See what commits were pushed onto that branch to customize it.
4. Create a PR to cherry-pick the same commits to the new branch. See the [changes to the 0.85 branch](https://github.com/grafana/opentelemetry-collector/pull/8) for an example PR.
5. Run `make` on the branch to make sure it builds and that the tests pass.

### Update the Agent's dependencies

1. Make sure we use the same version of Collector and Collector-Contrib for all relevant modules. For example, if we use version `v0.86.0` of Collector, we should also use version `v0.86.0` for all Contrib modules.
2. Update the `replace` directives in the go.mod file to point to the latest commit of the forked release branch. Use a command like this:
   ```
   go mod edit -replace=go.opentelemetry.io/collector=github.com/grafana/opentelemetry-collector@asdf123jkl
   ```
   Repeat this for any other modules where a replacement is necessary. For debugging purposes, you can first have the replace directive pointing to your local repo.
3. Note that sometimes Collector depends on packages with "rc" versions such as `v1.0.0-rcv0013`. This is ok, as long as the go.mod of Collector also references the same versions - for example, [pdata](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/v0.81.0/go.mod#L25) and [featuregate](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/v0.81.0/go.mod#L24).

### Update otelcol Flow components

1. Note which Otel components are in use by the Agent.
   * For every "otelcol" Flow component there is usually a corresponding Collector component.
   * For example, the Otel component used by [otelcol.auth.sigv4](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/reference/components/otelcol.auth.sigv4/) is [sigv4auth](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/sigv4authextension).
   * In some cases we don't use the corresponding Collector component:
     * For example, [otelcol.receiver.prometheus](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/reference/components/otelcol.receiver.prometheus/) and [otelcol.exporter.prometheus](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/reference/components/otelcol.exporter.prometheus/).
     * Those components usually have a note like this:
       > NOTE: otelcol.exporter.prometheus is a custom component unrelated to the prometheus exporter from OpenTelemetry Collector.
2. Make a list of the components which have changed since the previously used version.
   1. Go through the changelogs of both [Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/releases) and [Collector-Contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases).
   2. If a component which is in use by the Agent has changed, note it down.
3. For each Otel component which has changed, compare how they changed.
   1. Compare the old and new version of Otel's documentation.
   2. Compare the config.go file to see if new parameters were added.
4. Update the Agent's code and documentation where needed.
   * Pay attention to stability labels:
      * Never lower the stability label in the Agent. E.g. if the stability 
       of an Otel component is "alpha", there are cases where it might be 
       stable in the Agent and that is ok. Stability labels in the Agent can 
       be increased, but not decreased.
      * If the stability level of an Otel component has increased, consult 
      the rest of the team on whether the stability of the corresponding 
      Agent component should also be increased.
   * Update the [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/static/configuration/traces-config/) 
     for Static mode's Tracing subsystem:.
   * Static mode's Tracing subsystem code should generally not updated to 
     have new parameters which have been added to the Otel components recently.
     If you do think it should be updated, check with the rest of the team on
     whether it is really necessary.
   * Search the Agent repository for the old version (e.g. "0.87") to find code and 
     documentation which also needs updating.
   * Update the `OTEL_VERSION` parameter in the `docs/sources/_index.md.t` file.
     Then run `make generate-versioned-files`, which will update `docs/sources/_index.md`.
5. Some Agent components reuse OpenTelemetry code, but do not import it:
   * `otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling`: a lot of this code has 
     been copy-pasted from Otel and modified slightly to fit the Agent's needs.
     This component needs to be updated by copy-pasting the new Otel code 
     and modifying it again.
6. Note that we don't port every single config option which OpenTelemetry Collector exposes.
   For example, Collector's [oauth2client extension](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/v0.85.0/extension/oauth2clientauthextension) supports `client_id_file` and `client_secret_file`
   parameters. However, Agent's [otelcol.auth.oauth2](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/reference/components/otelcol.auth.oauth2/) does not support them because the idiomatic way of doing the same
   in the Agent is to use the local.file component.
7. When updating semantic conventions, check those the changelogs of those repositories for breaking changes:
   * [opentelemetry-go](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/releases)
   * [semantic-conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/releases)
   * [opentelemetry-specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/releases)

You can refer to [PR #5290](https://github.com/grafana/agent/pull/5290)
for an example on how to update the Agent.

## Testing

### Testing a tracing pipeline locally

You can use the resources in the [Tempo repository](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/tree/main/example/docker-compose/agent) to create a local source of traces using k6. You can also start your own Tempo and Grafana instances.

1. Comment out the "agent" and "prometheus" sections in the [docker-compose](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/example/docker-compose/agent/docker-compose.yaml). We don't need this - instead, we will start our own locally built Agent.
2. Change the "k6-tracing" endpoint to send traces on the localhost, outside of the Docker container.
   * For example, use `ENDPOINT=host.docker.internal:4320`.
   * Then our local Agent should be configured to accept traces on `0.0.0.0:4320`.
3. Optionally, e.g. if you prefer Grafana Cloud, comment out the "tempo" and "grafana" sections of the docker-compose file.
4. Add a second k6 instance if needed - for example, when testing a Static Agent which has 2 Traces instances.

### Static mode

The [tracing subsystem](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/static/configuration/traces-config/) is the only part of Static mode which uses Otel. Try to test as many features of it using a config file like this one:

Run this file for two types of Agents - an upgraded one, and another one built using the codebase of the `main` branch. Check the following:

* Open `localhost:12345/metrics` in your browser for both Agents.
  * Are new metrics added? Mention them in the changelog.
  * Are metrics missing? Did any metrics change names? If it's intended, mention them in the changelog and the upgrade guide.
* Try opening `localhost:8888/metrics` in your browser for the new Agent. 8888 is the Collector's default port for exposing metrics. Make sure this page doesn't display anything - the Agent should use port `12345` instead.
* Check the logs for errors or anything else that's suspicious.
* Check Tempo to make sure the traces were received.
* Check Loki to make sure the logs generated from traces got received.
* Check `localhost:8899/metrics` to make sure the span metrics are being generated.
