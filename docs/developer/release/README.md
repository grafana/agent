# Releasing

This document describes the process of creating a release for the
`grafana/agent` repo. A release includes release assets for everything inside
the repository, including Grafana Agent and Grafana Agent Operator.

The processes described here are for v0.24.0 and above.

# Release Cycle

A typical release cycle is to have a Release Candidate published for at least 48 
hours followed by a Stable Release. 0 or more Patch Releases may occur between the Stable Release
and the creation of the next Release Candidate.

responsible for ownership of the following workflows:

## Patch Release Publish (older version)
- Not documented yet (but here are some hints)
  - somewhat similar to Patch Release Publish (latest version)
  - find the old release branch
  - cherry-pick commit[s] into it
  - don't update the version in the project on main
  - changes go into the changelog under the patch release version plus stay in unreleased
  - don't update the `release` branch
  - don't publish in github as latest release
  - don't update deployment tools or helm charts
