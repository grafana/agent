# Guide to setting up a Windows Server for Certificate Testing

This guide is used to set up a Windows Server for Windows Store Certificate Testing. This guide assumes you have downloaded a Windows 2022 Server ISO and have installed the Windows Server onto a virtual machine. Certificate Templates can only be installed on Windows Server and it must enabled as an Enterprise Certificate Authority. This guide is NOT meant to be a guide on how to set up a Windows Server for production use, and is meant only for setting up an environment to test the Grafana Agent and certificate store.

## Prerequisites

* The install should be fresh with no server roles defined or installed. 
* You should be logged in via an administrator account.

## Set up as domain controller

1. Add `Active Directory Domain Services`.
2. Add to a new forest, and when asked for a name, use `test.example.com`.
3. Add a NETBIOS name `TESTCERT`.
4. Continue the feature install until done.
6. Reboot. If the set up succeeded, your username will be prefixed with `TESTCERT/` on login screen.


## Set up certificate management

For this setup we are using a one-node Domain Controller set up as the Enterprise CA.

1. Go to the Server Management window.

15. It will now show in the Templates folder of Certificate Authority.

## Creating a certificate from the template

1. Open `certmgr` also called `Manage user certificates` from the Run button.
2. Expand `Personal`, right-click on personal, select `All Tasks` , select `Request New Certificate`.
3. Click through until you get the `Request Certificate` screen and select `Certstore Template`.

6. Create Certificate.

## Export the certificate

1. From `certmgr` find the certificate you created and double click to open.
2. Go to the `Details` tab and select `Copy to File...`.
3. Ensure that `Allow private key to be exported` is selected.

4. Under `Export File Format` ensure that `Include all certificates in the certificate path if possible`.
5. Export it to a file.

## Setup Grafana Agent

1. Open the Agent configuration file.
2. Open `Certificate Templates Console`, right-click `Certstore Template` and find the Object identifier.

3. Copy the configuration file.
4. Find the common name, it is `test-WIN-TF2GPD2VTOT-CA` in the screenshot.
![](./images/common_name.png)

5. Copy that to the configuration.
6. Configuration should look like this.
![](./images/config.png)

7. Start Agent.

## Copy certificate to browser

1. Open browser.
2. Find certificate management.
3. Add certificate we exported in `Export the certificate`.
4. Browse to `http://localhost:12345/metrics`, and it should work properly. You may need to tell it to trust the certificate though.
