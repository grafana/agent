# Writing documentation for Flow components

This guide outlines best practices for writing reference documentation for Flow
components.

Component reference documentation is stored in [docs/sources/flow/reference/components][docs source],
and published to [Grafana's documentation website][hosted docs].

Documentation for a component should follow best practices as much as possible
so that things are kept consistent. Exceptions can be made when needed; see the
list of [Exceptions][] at the bottom of this page for examples.

## General guidelines

* Follow the [Grafana Writers' Toolkit](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/).
* Follow the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
* Prefer being explicit over making assumptions; assume that your documentation
  may be the first page someone visits.
* Aim for component documentation to be consistent with documentation for other
  components.
* Refer to the component by its full name as much as possible rather than "the
  component."
* Do not use backticks in headers.

## Page structure

Component reference pages should start with YAML frontmatter containing the
name of the component as the page title:

```markdown
---
title: COMPONENT_NAME
---
```

If documenting a beta component, include the following inside the frontmatter:

```markdown
labels:
  stage: beta
```

If documenting an experimental component, include the following inside the
frontmatter:

```markdown
labels:
  stage: experimental
```

All component reference pages should always be broken down into the following
sections:

1. Title
2. Usage
3. Arguments
4. Blocks
5. Exported fields
6. Component health
7. Debug information
8. Debug metrics
9. Examples

If a section does not apply to a component (such as a component not exposing
any debug information), the section should still be included, with a sentence
explicitly documenting that it does not apply to a component. For example:

```markdown
## Debug information

`COMPONENT_NAME` does not expose any component-specific debug information.
```

Always including the headers removes as much guesswork as possible from
readers, so they know for certain that there is no debug information, rather
than assuming it must not exist if it's not documented.


### Title

The Title section is an `h1` section which provides a brief description of the
component. The header should be named after the component. For example:

```markdown
# local.file

`local.file` exposes the contents of a file on disk to other components.

The most common use of `local.file` is to load secrets (e.g., API keys) from
files.
```

Use backticks when referring to the component in the body of the Title section,
but do not use backticks in the header.

The Title section should be kept high-level and as small as possible. Detailed
information on component behavior should be kept to [Arguments](#Arguments) and
[Blocks](#Blocks) sections as appropriate.

If your component supports labels, add the following as the last paragraph of
the Title section:

```markdown
Multiple `COMPONENT_NAME` components can be specified by giving them different
labels.
```

If documenting a beta component, include the following after the header, but
before the description of the component:

```markdown
{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/stability/beta.md" source="agent" >}}
```

If documenting an experimental component, include the following instead:

```markdown
{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/stability/experimental.md" source="agent" >}}
```

### Usage

The Usage section provides a minimal example containing _required_ attributes
and blocks to configure a component.

It starts with an `h2` header called Usage.

The Usage section should be composed of a single River code block, with no
description. Use `YELLING_SNAKE_CASE` to refer to values the user must replace.
For example:

````markdown
## Usage

```river
pyroscope.scrape "LABEL" {
  targets    = TARGET_LIST
  forward_to = RECEIVER_LIST
}
```
````

### Arguments

The Arguments section details the set of arguments the component supports,
followed by a detailed descriptions of how the arguments modify the component
behavior. The section starts with an `h2` header called Arguments.

If the component does not support any arguments, and is only configured through
blocks, the content of the section should be the following paragraph:

```markdown
The `COMPONENT_NAME` component does not support any arguments, and is configured
fully through child blocks.
```

When arguments are supported by the component, the set of arguments should be
listed using a Markdown table, with the following columns:

| Column      | Description                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Name        | Argument name.                    |
| Type        | Argument type.                    |
| Description | Argument description.             |
| Default     | Default value for the argument.   |
| Required    | Whether the argument is required. |

A paragraph with the content "The following arguments are supported:" should
always prefix the arguments table.

For example:

```markdown
The following arguments are supported:

Name             | Type       | Description                            | Default      | Required |
---------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
`filename`       | `string`   | Path of the file on disk to watch.     |              | yes      |
`detector`       | `string`   | Which file change detector to use.     | `"fsnotify"` | no       |
`poll_frequency` | `duration` | How often to poll for file changes.    | `"1m"`       | no       |
`is_secret`      | `bool`     | Marks the file as containing a secret. | `false`      | no       |
```

Values for the Name column should be the backticked argument name, such as ``
`targets` ``.

Values for the Type column should be the backticked River type (for example,
`string`, `bool`, `number`). Arrays should be represented as
`list(INNER_TYPE)`, and dictionaries should be represented as
`map(VALUE_TYPE)`.

In addition to the known types, the following are excepted as convention:

* `duration`: A string which is parsed as a duration.
* `secret`: A string which is treated as sensitive.
* `capsule(T)`: An internal encapsulated value.

Values for the Description column should be kept as short as possible to keep
the table small and readable. Detailed descriptions should be placed outside of
the table. Use full sentences for argument descriptions, ending them in
periods.

Values for the Default column may be omitted if the default is the zero value
for the given River type. The Default column must be empty for required
attributes.

Values for the Required column must be either "yes" (for required attributes)
or "no" (for optional attributes).

The set of documented attributes should only contain attributes in the root
block of the component. The list of supported blocks and the list of attributes
for those blocks are documented in other sections.

It is not required for cells in the Markdown table to be aligned with
whitespace.

A detailed description of component behavior and how arguments affect that
component behavior should follow the arguments table. To refer to an argument,
use ``The `ARGUMENT_NAME` argument`` to make it extremely clear what you're
referring to.

Descriptions for component behavior should be limited to what is directly
relevant to the arguments. If there is component behavior relevant to a
specific block, describe that component behavior in the documentation section
for that block instead.

It is acceptable to provide Flow configuration snippets for the arguments
if it aids documentation.

### Blocks

The Blocks section details the hierarchy of blocks the component supports. The
section starts with an `h2` header called Blocks.

If the component does not support any blocks, the content of the section should
be the following paragraph:

```markdown
The `COMPONENT_NAME` component does not support any blocks, and is configured
fully through arguments.
```

When blocks are supported by the component, the set of blocks should be listed
using a Markdown table, with the following columns:

| Column      | Description                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Hierarchy   | Block path.                       |
| Block       | Link to block documentation.      |
| Description | Block description.                |
| Required    | Whether the block is required.    |

For example:

```markdown
The following blocks are supported:

Hierarchy                    | Block             | Description                        | Required |
---------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
client                       | [client][]        | HTTP client settings.              | no       |
client > basic_auth          | [basic_auth][]    | Basic authentication settings.     | no       |
client > authorization       | [authorization][] | Generic authentication settings.   | no       |
client > oauth2              | [oauth2][]        | OAuth 2.0 authentication settings. | no       |
client > oauth2 > tls_config | [tls_config][]    | TLS settings for OAuth 2.0.        | no       |
client > tls_config          | [tls_config][]    | TLS settings the HTTP client.      | no       |
```

Values for the Hierarchy column should be the path to the block from the
component. Use the `>` character to represent nested blocks. Do not surround
the value in backticks, as it looks strange when rendered to the table.

Values for the Block column should contain a link to the header in the same
documentation page which describes the block. **Do not** link to another
component page that happens to have the same block; prefer re-documenting
blocks and being explicit instead of having users jump around. Use the
[`docs/shared` shortcode][docs-shared] to de-duplicate block definitions across
multiple components.

Values for the Description column should be kept as short as possible to keep
the table small and readable. Use full sentences for block descriptions,
ending them in periods.

Values for the Required column should be the text "yes" (for required blocks)
or "no" (for optional blocks).

If nested blocks are used in the blocks table (like `client > basic_auth` in
the example), a description of what the `>` symbol means should be included in
the following paragraph after the block table:

```markdown
The `>` symbol indicates deeper levels of nesting. For example,
`PARENT_BLOCK > CHILD_BLOCK` refers to a `CHILD_BLOCK` block defined inside
an `PARENT_BLOCK` block.
```

When including this paragraph, replace `PARENT_BLOCK` and `CHILD_BLOCK` with
block names from your component to provide a concrete example of what the
hierarchy represents.

A paragraph with the content "The following blocks are supported:" should
always prefix the blocks table.

A set of sub-sections for each defined block should follow the Blocks section.
Each unique block type will only have one Block section, regardless of how many
times that block type appears in the blocks table. See [Block section](#block-section)
for a description on these sections.

[docs-shared]: https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/reuse-shared-content/

#### Block section

The Block section is a sub-section of Blocks describing an individual block
supported by a component. There is one Block section per recognized block type
within the component.

The Block section starts with an `h3` header with the name of the block,
followed by the word "block." Do not surround the name of the block in
backticks in the header.

Block sections are similar to Arguments section, where it is composed of:

1. A brief description of the block.
2. A table of arguments supported by the block.
3. Detailed description for how that block impacts component behavior, and how
   the block's arguments can be used to modify that behavior.

See [Arguments](#arguments) for a description of how to write the arguments
table and block-level descriptions following that table.

For example:

```markdown
### tls block

The `tls` block configures TLS settings used when connecting to the server. If
the `tls` block isn't provided, connections to the server are unencrypted.

The following arguments are supported:

Name              | Type       | Description                                                   | Default | Required |
----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
`ca_file`         | `string`   | Path to the CA file.                                          |         | no       |
`cert_file`       | `string`   | Path to the TLS certificate.                                  |         | no       |
`key_file`        | `string`   | Path to the TLS certificate key.                              |         | no       |
`min_version`     | `string`   | Minimum acceptable TLS version for connections.               |         | no       |
`max_version`     | `string`   | Maximum acceptable TLS version for connections.               |         | no       |
`reload_interval` | `duration` | Frequency to reload the certificates.                         |         | no       |
`client_ca_file`  | `string`   | Path to the CA file used to authenticate client certificates. |         | no       |

Default values for the `min_version` and `max_version` arguments are inherited
from Go, currently TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 respectively. When these arguments are
not provided, their Go-inherited defaults will not display in the component UI
page.
```

It is acceptable for block sections to provide Flow configuration snippets for
the block if it aids documentation.

### Exported fields

The Exported fields section details a list of fields which the component
exports. The section starts with an `h2` header called Exported fields.

If the component does not export any fields, the content of the section should
be the following paragraph:

```markdown
The `COMPONENT_NAME` component does not export any values.
```

When the component exports values, it should provide a table of exported values
with the following columns:

| Column      | Description                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Name        | Name of exported value.           |
| Type        | River type of exported value.     |
| Description | Description of exported value.    |

Values for the Name column should be the backticked exported field name, such
as `` `targets` ``.

Values for the Type column should be the backticked River type. These types
should follow the same guidelines detailed in the Type column in the [Arguments
block](#arguments).

Values for the description column should be kept as short as possible to keep
the table small and readable.

A paragraph with the content "The following fields are exported and can be
referenced by other components:" should always prefix the exported fields
table.

Following the exported fields table, a longer description of each exported
fields may be provided, but this normally isn't done.

### Component health

The Component health section describes when the component is healthy. The
section starts with an `h2` header called Component health.

If the component does not have special health logic, the content of the section
should be the following paragraph:

```markdown
`COMPONENT_NAME` is only reported as unhealthy if given an invalid
configuration.
```

Otherwise, write a detailed description for when the component is reported as
healthy.

### Debug information

The Debug information section describes debug information exposed in the
Grafana Agent Flow UI. The section starts with an `h2` header called Debug
information.

If the component does not expose any debug information, the content of the
section should be the following paragraph:

```markdown
`COMPONENT_NAME` does not expose any component-specific debug information.
```

Otherwise, write a high-level description for what debug information the
component provides. Do not document the attributes or blocks which are exposed
through the debug information.

### Debug metrics

The Debug metrics section describes what Prometheus metrics are exposed by a
component. The section starts with an `h2` header called Debug metrics.

If the component does not expose any debug metrics, the content of the section
should be the following paragraph:

```markdown
`COMPONENT_NAME` does not expose any component-specific debug metrics.
```

When the component exports values, it should provide a table of exposed metrics
with the following columns:

| Column      | Description                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Name        | Name of Prometheus metric.        |
| Type        | Prometheus metric type.           |
| Description | Metric description.               |

Values in the Name and Type column should be backticked.

Values in the Type column should be a Prometheus metric type, one of `counter`,
`gauge`, `histogram`, `native histogram`, or `summary`.

A paragraph with the content "The following Prometheus metrics are exposed:"
should always prefix the metrics table.

### Examples

The Examples section provides copy-and-paste River pipelines which use the
Flow component. The section starts with an `h2` header called Examples. If
there is only one example, call the section Example instead.

The Examples section should be composed of a brief description of each example,
followed by the example in a code block. For example:

````markdown
This example reads a JSON array of objects from an endpoint and uses them for
the set of scrape targets:

```river
remote.http "targets" {
  url = TARGETS_URL
}

prometheus.scrape "default" {
  targets    = json_decode(remote.http.targets.content)
  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.default.receiver]
}

prometheus.remote_write "default" {
  client {
    url = PROMETHEUS_URL
  }
}
```
Replace the following:
  - `TARGETS_URL`: The URL to fetch the JSON array of objects from.
  - `PROMETHEUS_URL`: The URL of the Prometheus remote_write-compatible server to send metrics to.
````

Each example should be a full pipeline when possible, rather than just the
individual component being documented.

Placeholders should follow the [Google style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/placeholders#placeholder-text), where they are
written in all uppercase and underscore delimited, for example: `API_URL`.

Examples of the new component should avoid using placeholders and instead use
realistic example values. For example, if documenting a `prometheus.scrape` component, use:
  
  ```river
  remote.http "targets" {
    url = "http://localhost:8080/targets"
  }
  ```

If an example includes a placeholder, make sure to include a brief description
of what the placeholder is. For example:

```markdown
Replace `API_URL` with the URL of the API to query.
```

or if there are multiple placeholders:

````markdown
Replace the following:
  - `API_URL`: The URL of the API to query.
  - `API_KEY`: The API key to use when querying the API.
````

If an example includes clarifying comments, make sure that the relevant
Arguments or block header includes sufficient explanation to be the official
source for the clarifying comment. Clarifying comments must only be used be
supplementary information to reenforce knowledge, and not as the primary source
of information.

Examples should be formatted using the [grafana-agent fmt](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/reference/cli/fmt/) command.

## Exceptions

The rules described in this page should be sufficient in most cases for being
able to write detailed documentation.

However, there have been some cases where the page structure needed to be
changed to properly document a component. The following sections will describe
some instances where exceptions had to be made.

### loki.source.podlogs

The [loki.source.podlogs][] component documentation needed to add an extra
section to document the PodLogs CRD, since we do not yet have a way of
documenting auxiliary artifacts which are related to a component.

[loki.source.podlogs]: ../sources/flow/reference/components/loki.source.podlogs.md
