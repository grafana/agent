# integrations_config

The `integrations_config` block configures how the Agent runs integrations that
scrape and send metrics without needing to run specific Prometheus exporters or
manually write `scrape_configs`:

```yaml
# Controls the Agent integration
agent:
  # Enables the Agent integration, allowing the Agent to automatically
  # collect and send metrics about itself.
  [enabled: <boolean> | default = false]

  # Automatically collect metrics from this integration. If disabled,
  # the agent integration will be run but not scraped and thus not
  # remote_written. Metrics for the integration will be exposed at
  # /integrations/agent/metrics and can be scraped by an external process.
  [scrape_integration: <boolean> | default = <integrations_config.scrape_integrations>]

  # How often should the metrics be collected? Defaults to
  # prometheus.global.scrape_interval.
  [scrape_interval: <duration> | default = <global_config.scrape_interval>]

  # The timtout before considering the scrape a failure. Defaults to
  # prometheus.global.scrape_timeout.
  [scrape_timeout: <duration> | default = <global_config.scrape_timeout>]

  # How frequent to truncate the WAL for this integration.
  [wal_truncate_frequency: <duration> | default = "60m"]

  # Allows for relabeling labels on the target.
  relabel_configs:
    [- <relabel_config> ... ]

  # Relabel metrics coming from the integration, allowing to drop series
  # from the integration that you don't care about.
  metric_relabel_configs:

### node_exporter_config

The `node_exporter_config` block configures the `node_exporter` integration,
which is an embedded version of
[`node_exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)
and allows for collecting metrics from the UNIX system that `node_exporter` is
running on. It provides a significant amount of collectors that are responsible
for monitoring various aspects of the host system.

Note that if running the Agent in a container, you will need to bind mount
folders from the host system so the integration can monitor them. You can use
the example below, making sure to replace `/path/to/config.yaml` with a path on
your host machine where an Agent configuration file is:

```
docker run \
  --net="host" \
  --pid="host" \
  --cap-add=SYS_TIME \
  -v "/:/host/root:ro,rslave" \
  -v "/sys:/host/sys:ro,rslave" \
  -v "/proc:/host/proc:ro,rslave" \
  -v /tmp/agent:/etc/agent \
  -v /path/to/config.yaml:/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml \
  grafana/agent:v0.15.0 \
  --config.file=/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml
```

Use this configuration file for testing out `node_exporter` support, replacing
the `remote_write` settings with settings appropriate for you:

```yaml
server:
  log_level: info
  http_listen_port: 12345

prometheus:
  wal_directory: /tmp/agent
  global:
    scrape_interval: 15s
    remote_write:
    - url: https://prometheus-us-central1.grafana.net/api/prom/push
      basic_auth:
        username: user-id
        password: api-token

integrations:
  node_exporter:
    enabled: true
    rootfs_path: /host/root
    sysfs_path: /host/sys
    procfs_path: /host/proc
```

For running on Kubernetes, ensure to set the equivalent mounts and capabilities
there as well:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: agent
spec:
  containers:
  - image: grafana/agent:v0.15.0
    name: agent
    args:
    - --config.file=/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["SYS_TIME"]
      priviliged: true
      runAsUser: 0
    volumeMounts:
    - name: rootfs
      mountPath: /host/root
      readOnly: true
    - name: sysfs
      mountPath: /host/sys
      readOnly: true
    - name: procfs
      mountPath: /host/proc
      readOnly: true
  hostPID: true
  hostNetwork: true
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet
  volumes:
  - name: rootfs
    hostPath:
      path: /
  - name: sysfs
    hostPath:
      path: /sys
  - name: procfs
    hostPath:
      path: /proc
```

The manifest and Tanka configs provided by this repository do not have the
mounts or capabilities required for running this integration.

Some collectors only work on specific operating systems, documented in the
table below. Enabling a collector that is not supported by the operating system
the Agent is running on is a no-op.

### process_exporter_config

The `process_exporter_config` block configures the `process_exporter` integration,
which is an embedded version of
[`process-exporter`](https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter)
and allows for collection metrics based on the /proc filesystem on Linux
systems. Note that on non-Linux systems, enabling this exporter is a no-op.

Note that if running the Agent in a container, you will need to bind mount
folders from the host system so the integration can monitor them:

```
docker run \
  -v "/proc:/proc:ro" \
  -v /tmp/agent:/etc/agent \
  -v /path/to/config.yaml:/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml \
  grafana/agent:v0.15.0 \
  --config.file=/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml
```

Replace `/path/to/config.yaml` with the appropriate path on your host system
where an Agent config file can be found.

For running on Kubernetes, ensure to set the equivalent mounts and capabilities
there as well:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod

The manifest and Tanka configs provided by this repository do not have the

The `mysqld_exporter_config` block configures the `mysqld_exporter` integration,
which is an embedded version of
[`mysqld_exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter)
and allows for collection metrics from MySQL servers.

Note that currently, an Agent can only collect metrics from a single MySQL
server. If you want to collect metrics from multiple servers, run multiple
Agents and add labels using `relabel_configs` to differentiate between the MySQL
servers:

```yaml
mysqld_exporter:
  enabled: true
  data_source_name: root@(server-a:3306)/
  relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__address__]
    target_label: instance
    replacement: server-a
```
