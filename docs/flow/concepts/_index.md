# Concepts

Grafana Agent Flow has three primary concepts:

1. [Components][]: The building blocks of Grafana Agent Flow which can be wired
   together to construct a pipeline.

2. [Component controller][]: The system within Grafana Agent Flow which manages
   and updates components.

3. [Configuration language][]: The language used to configure and wire together
   components.
