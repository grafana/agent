The `debug_metrics` block configures the metrics that this component generates to monitor its state.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`disable_high_cardinality_metrics` | `boolean` | Whether to disable certain high cardinality metrics. | `false` | no

`disable_high_cardinality_metrics` is the Grafana Agent equivalent to the
`telemetry.disableHighCardinalityMetrics` feature gate in the OpenTelemetry
Collector. It removes attributes which could cause high cardinality metrics. For
example, attributes with IP addresses and port numbers in metrics about HTTP
and gRPC connections will be removed.
