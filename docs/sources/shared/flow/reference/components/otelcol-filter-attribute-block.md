This block specifies an attribute to match against:

* More than one `attribute` block can be defined.
* Only `match_type = "strict"` is allowed if `attribute` is specified.
* All `attribute` blocks must match exactly for a match to occur.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`key` | `string` | The attribute key. | | yes
`value` | `any` | The attribute value to match against. | | no

If `value` is not set, any value will match.
The type of `value` could be a number, a string, or a boolean.
