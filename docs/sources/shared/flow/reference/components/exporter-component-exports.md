The following fields are exported and can be referenced by other components.

Name      | Type                | Description
--------- | ------------------- | -----------
`targets` | `list(map(string))` | The targets that can be used to collect exporter metrics.

For example, the `targets` can either be passed to a `discovery.relabel`
component to rewrite the targets' label sets, or to a `prometheus.scrape`
component that collects the exposed metrics.

The exported targets will use the configured [in-memory traffic][] address
specified by the [run command][].

[in-memory traffic]: {{< relref "../../../../flow/concepts/component_controller.md#in-memory-traffic" >}}
[run command]: {{< relref "../../../../flow/reference/cli/run.md" >}}
