The `:authority` header in gRPC specifies the host to which the request is being sent.
It is similar to the `Host` [header][HTTP host header] in HTTP requests. By default, 
the value for `:authority` is derived from the endpoint URL used for the gRPC call. 
Overriding `:authority` could be useful when routing traffic using a proxy like Envoy, which 
[makes routing decisions][Envoy route matching] based on the value of the `:authority` header.
