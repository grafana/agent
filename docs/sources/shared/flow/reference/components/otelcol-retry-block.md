The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`enabled` | `boolean` | Enables retrying failed requests. | `true` | no
`initial_interval` | `duration` | Initial time to wait before retrying a failed request. | `"5s"` | no
`randomization_factor` | `number` | Factor to randomize wait time before retrying. | `0.5` | no
`multiplier` | `number` | Factor to grow wait time before retrying. | `1.5` | no
`max_interval` | `duration` | Maximum time to wait between retries. | `"30s"` | no
`max_elapsed_time` | `duration` | Maximum amount of time to wait before discarding a failed batch. | `"5m"` | no

When `enabled` is `true`, failed batches are retried after a given interval.
The `initial_interval` argument specifies how long to wait before the first
retry attempt. If requests continue to fail, the time to wait before retrying
increases by the factor specified by the `multiplier` argument, which must be
greater than `1.0`. The `max_interval` argument specifies the upper bound of
how long to wait between retries.

The `randomization_factor` argument is useful for adding jitter between retrying agents.
If `randomization_factor` is greater than `0`, the wait time before retries is
multiplied by a random factor in the range 
`[ I - randomization_factor * I, I + randomization_factor * I]`, 
where `I` is the current interval.

If a batch has not sent successfully, it is discarded after the time specified
by `max_elapsed_time` elapses. If `max_elapsed_time` is set to `"0s"`, failed
requests are retried forever until they succeed.
