description: Shared content, otelcol filter library block
headless: true
---

This block specifies properties to match the implementation library against:

* More than one `library` block can be defined.
* A match occurs if the span's implementation library matches at least one `library` block.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`name` | `string` | The attribute key. | | yes
`version` | `string` | The version to match against. | null | no

If `version` is unset, any version will match. If `version` is set to an empty string, it will only match 
a library version which is also an empty string.
