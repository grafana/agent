# Stability

Stability of functionality usually refers to the stability of a _use case,_
such as collecting and forwarding OpenTelemetry metrics.

Features within the Grafana Agent project will fall into one of three stability
categories:

* **Experimental**: A new use case is being explored.
* **Beta**: Functionality covering a use case is being matured.
* **Stable**: Functionality covering a use case is believed to be stable.

The default stability is stable; features will be explicitly marked as
experimental or beta if they are not stable.

## Experimental

The **experimental** stability category is used to denote that maintainers are
exploring a new use case, and would like feedback.

* Experimental features are subject to frequent breaking changes.
* Experimental features can be removed with no equivalent replacement.
* Experimental features may require enabling feature flags to use.

Unless removed, experimental features eventually graduate to beta.

## Beta

The **beta** stability category is used to denote a feature which is being
matured.

* Beta features are subject to occasional breaking changes.
* Beta features can be replaced by equivalent functionality that covers the
  same use case.
* Beta features can be used without enabling feature flags.

Unless replaced with equivalent functionality, beta features eventually
graduate to stable.

## Stable

The **stable** stability category is used to denote a feature as stable.

* Breaking changes to stable features are rare, and will be well-documented.
* If new functionality is introduced to replace existing stable functionality,
  deprecation and removal timeline will be well-documented.
* Stable features can be used without enabling feature flags.
