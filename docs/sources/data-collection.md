# Data collection

By default, Grafana Agent sends anonymous but uniquely identifiable usage information from
your Grafana Agent instance to Grafana Labs. These statistics are sent to `stats.grafana.org`.

Statistics help us better understand how Grafana Agent is used. This helps us prioritize features and documentation.

The usage information includes the following details:

* A randomly generated, anonymous unique ID (UUID).
* Timestamp of when the UID was first generated.
* Timestamp of when the report was created (by default, every four hours).
* Version of running Grafana Agent.
* Operating system Grafana Agent is running on.
* System architecture Grafana Agent is running on.
* List of enabled feature flags ([Static] mode only).
* List of enabled integrations ([Static] mode only).
* List of enabled [components][] ([Flow] mode only).
* Method used to deploy Grafana Agent, for example Docker, Helm, RPM, or Operator.

This list may change over time. All newly reported data is documented in the CHANGELOG.

## Opt-out of data collection

You can use the `-disable-reporting` [command line flag][] to disable the reporting and opt-out of the data collection.
