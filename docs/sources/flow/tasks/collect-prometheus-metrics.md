# Collect and forward Prometheus metrics

You can configure {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} to collect [Prometheus][] metrics and forward them to any Prometheus-compatible database.

This topic describes how to:

* Configure metrics delivery.
* Collect metrics from Kubernetes Pods.

## Components used in this topic

* [discovery.kubernetes][]
* [prometheus.remote_write][]
* [prometheus.scrape][]

## Before you begin

* Ensure that you have basic familiarity with instrumenting applications with Prometheus.
* Have a set of Prometheus exports or applications exposing Prometheus metrics that you want to collect metrics from.
* Identify where you will write collected metrics.
  Metrics can be written to Prometheus or Prometheus-compatible endpoints such as Grafana Mimir, Grafana Cloud, or Grafana Enterprise Metrics.
* Be familiar with the concept of [Components][] in {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}.

## Configure metrics delivery

Before components can collect Prometheus metrics, you must have a component responsible for writing those metrics somewhere.

The [prometheus.remote_write][] component is responsible for delivering Prometheus metrics to one or Prometheus-compatible endpoints.
After a `prometheus.remote_write` component is defined, you can use other {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} components to forward metrics to it.

To configure a `prometheus.remote_write` component for metrics delivery, complete the following steps:

1. Add the following `prometheus.remote_write` component to your configuration file.

   ```river
   prometheus.remote_write "<LABEL>" {
     endpoint {
       url = "<PROMETHEUS_URL>"
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace the following:

   - _`<LABEL>`_: The label for the component, such as `default`.
     The label you use must be unique across all `prometheus.remote_write` components in the same configuration file.
   - _`<PROMETHEUS_URL>`_ The full URL of the Prometheus-compatible endpoint where metrics will be sent, such as `https://prometheus-us-central1.grafana.net/api/prom/push`.

1. If your endpoint requires basic authentication, paste the following inside the `endpoint` block.

   ```river
   basic_auth {
     username = "<USERNAME>"
     password = "<PASSWORD>"
   }
   ```

   Replace the following:

   - _`<USERNAME>`_: The basic authentication username.
   - _`<PASSWORD>`_: The basic authentication password or API key.

1. If you have more than one endpoint to write metrics to, repeat the `endpoint` block for additional endpoints.

The following example demonstrates configuring `prometheus.remote_write` with multiple endpoints and mixed usage of basic authentication, and a `prometheus.scrape` component which forwards metrics to it.

```river
prometheus.remote_write "default" {
  endpoint {
    url = "http://localhost:9090/api/prom/push"
  }

  endpoint {
    url = "https://prometheus-us-central1.grafana.net/api/prom/push"

    // Get basic authentication based on environment variables.
    basic_auth {
      username = env("<REMOTE_WRITE_USERNAME>")
      password = env("<REMOTE_WRITE_PASSWORD>")
    }
  }
}

prometheus.scrape "example" {
  // Collect metrics from the default listen address.
  targets = [{
    __address__ = "127.0.0.1:12345",
  }]

  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.default.receiver]
}
```

For more information on configuring metrics delivery, refer to [prometheus.remote_write][].


    TODO: We should integrate the below instructions somehow with the new content.
    This is probably a good guide for someone who wants to write their own config.
    We should let them know that there is a full guide to collecting Prometheus 
    metrics on Kubernetes using the kubernetes module and annotations as our recommended alternative.

## Collect metrics from Kubernetes Pods

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} can be configured to collect metrics from Kubernetes Pods by:

1. Discovering Kubernetes Pods to collect metrics from.
1. Collecting metrics from those discovered Pods.

To collect metrics from Kubernetes Pods, complete the following steps:

1. Follow [Configure metrics delivery](#configure-metrics-delivery) to ensure collected metrics can be written somewhere.

1. Discover Kubernetes Pods:

    1. Add the following `discovery.kubernetes` component to your configuration file to discover every Pod in the cluster across all Namespaces.

       ```river
       discovery.kubernetes "<DISCOVERY_LABEL>" {
         role = "pod"
       }
       ```

       Replace the following

       - _`<DISCOVERY_LABEL>`_: The label for the component, such as `pods`.
         The label you use must be unique across all `discovery.kubernetes` components in the same configuration file.

       This generates one Prometheus target for every exposed port on every discovered Pod.

    1. To limit the Namespaces that Pods are discovered in, add the following block inside the `discovery.kubernetes` component.

       ```river
       namespaces {
         own_namespace = true
         names         = [<NAMESPACE_NAMES>]
       }
       ```

       Replace the following:

       - _`<NAMESPACE_NAMES>`_: A comma-delimited list of strings representing Namespaces to search.
         Each string must be wrapped in double quotes. For example, `"default","kube-system"`.

       If you don't want to search for Pods in the Namespace {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is running in, set `own_namespace` to `false`.

    1. To use a field selector to limit the number of discovered Pods, add the following block inside the `discovery.kubernetes` component.

       ```river
       selectors {
         role  = "pod"
         field = "<FIELD_SELECTOR>"
       }
       ```

       Replace the following:

       - _`<FIELD_SELECTOR>`_: The Kubernetes field selector to use, such as `metadata.name=my-service`.
         For more information on field selectors, refer to the Kubernetes documentation on [Field Selectors][].

       Create additional `selectors` blocks for each field selector you want to apply.

    1. To use a label selector to limit the number of discovered Pods, add the following block inside the `discovery.kubernetes` component.

       ```river
       selectors {
         role  = "pod"
         label = "LABEL_SELECTOR"
       }
       ```

       Replace the following:

       - _`<LABEL_SELECTOR>`_: The Kubernetes label selector, such as `environment in (production, qa)`.
         For more information on label selectors, refer to the Kubernetes documentation on [Labels and Selectors][].

       Create additional `selectors` blocks for each label selector you want to apply.

1. Collect metrics from discovered Pods:

    1. Add the following `prometheus.scrape` component to your configuration file.

       ```river
       prometheus.scrape "<SCRAPE_LABEL>" {
         targets    = discovery.kubernetes.<DISCOVERY_LABEL>.targets
         forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.<REMOTE_WRITE_LABEL>.receiver]
       }
       ```

       Replace the following:

       - _`<SCRAPE_LABEL>`_: The label for the component, such as `pods`.
         The label you use must be unique across all `prometheus.scrape` components in the same configuration file.
       - _`<DISCOVERY_LABEL>`_: The label for the `discovery.kubernetes` component.
       - _`<REMOTE_WRITE_LABEL>`_: The label for your existing `prometheus.remote_write` component.

The following example demonstrates configuring {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} to collect metrics from running production Kubernetes Pods in the `default` Namespace.

```river
discovery.kubernetes "pods" {
  role = "pod"

  namespaces {
    own_namespace = false

    names = ["default"]
  }

  selectors {
    role  = "pod"
    label = "environment in (production)"
  }
}

prometheus.scrape "pods" {
  targets    = discovery.kubernetes.pods.targets
  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.default.receiver]
}

prometheus.remote_write "default" {
  endpoint {
    url = "http://localhost:9090/api/prom/push"
  }
}
```

For more information on configuring Kubernetes service delivery and collecting metrics, refer to [discovery.kubernetes][] and [prometheus.scrape][].

## Collect metrics from Kubernetes Services

You can configure {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} to collect metrics from Kubernetes Services by:

1. Discovering Kubernetes Services to collect metrics from.
1. Collecting metrics from those discovered Services.

To collect metrics from Kubernetes Services, complete the following steps.

1. Follow [Configure metrics delivery](#configure-metrics-delivery) to ensure collected metrics can be written somewhere.

1. Discover Kubernetes Services:

    1. Add the following `discovery.kubernetes` component to your configuration file to discover every Services in the cluster across all Namespaces.

       ```river
       discovery.kubernetes "<DISCOVERY_LABEL>" {
         role = "service"
       }
       ```

       Replace the following:

       - _`<DISCOVERY_LABEL>`_: A label for the component, such as `services`.
         The label you use must be unique across all `discovery.kubernetes` components in the same configuration file.

       This will generate one Prometheus target for every exposed port on every discovered Service.

    1. To limit the Namespaces that Services are discovered in, add the following block inside the `discovery.kubernetes` component.

       ```river
       namespaces {
         own_namespace = true
         names         = [<NAMESPACE_NAMES>]
       }
       ```

       Replace the following:

       - _`<NAMESPACE_NAMES>`_: A comma-delimited list of strings representing Namespaces to search.
         Each string must be wrapped in double quotes. For example, `"default","kube-system"`.

       If you don't want to search for Services in the Namespace {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is running in, set `own_namespace` to `false`.

    1. To use a field selector to limit the number of discovered Services, add the following block inside the `discovery.kubernetes` component.

       ```river
       selectors {
         role  = "service"
         field = "<FIELD_SELECTOR>"
       }
       ```

       Replace the following:

       - _`<FIELD_SELECTOR>`_: The Kubernetes field selector, such as `metadata.name=my-service`.
         For more information on field selectors, refer to the Kubernetes documentation on [Field Selectors][].

       Create additional `selectors` blocks for each field selector you want to apply.

    1. To use a label selector to limit the number of discovered Services, add the following block inside the `discovery.kubernetes` component.

       ```river
       selectors {
         role  = "service"
         label = "<LABEL_SELECTOR>"
       }
       ```

       Replace the following:

       - _`<LABEL_SELECTOR>`_: The Kubernetes label selector, such as `environment in (production, qa)`.
         For more information on label selectors, refer to the Kubernetes documentation on [Labels and Selectors][].

       Create additional `selectors` blocks for each label selector you want to apply.

1. Collect metrics from discovered Services:

    1. Add the following `prometheus.scrape` component to your configuration file.

       ```river
       prometheus.scrape "<SCRAPE_LABEL>" {
         targets    = discovery.kubernetes.<DISCOVERY_LABEL>.targets
         forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.<REMOTE_WRITE_LABEL>.receiver]
       }
       ```

       Replace the following:

       - _`<SCRAPE_LABEL>`_: The label for the component, such as `services`.
         The label you use must be unique across all `prometeus.scrape` components in the same configuration file.
       - _`<DISCOVERY_LABEL>`_: The label for the `discovery.kubernetes` component.
       - _`<REMOTE_WRITE_LABEL>`_: The label for your existing `prometheus.remote_write` component.

The following example demonstrates configuring {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} to collect metrics from running production Kubernetes Services in the `default` Namespace.

```river
discovery.kubernetes "services" {
  role = "service"

  namespaces {
    own_namespace = false

    names = ["default"]
  }

  selectors {
    role  = "service"
    label = "environment in (production)"
  }
}

prometheus.scrape "services" {
  targets    = discovery.kubernetes.services.targets
  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.default.receiver]
}

prometheus.remote_write "default" {
  endpoint {
    url = "http://localhost:9090/api/prom/push"
  }
}
```

For more information on configuring Kubernetes service delivery and collecting metrics, refer to [discovery.kubernetes][] and [prometheus.scrape][].

## Collect metrics from custom targets

You can configure {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} to collect metrics from a custom set of targets without the need for service discovery.

To collect metrics from a custom set of targets, complete the following steps.

1. Follow [Configure metrics delivery][] to ensure collected metrics can be written somewhere.

1. Add the following `prometheus.scrape` component to your configuration file:

   ```river
   prometheus.scrape "<SCRAPE_LABEL>" {
     targets    = [<TARGET_LIST>]
     forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.<REMOTE_WRITE_LABEL>.receiver]
   }
   ```

   Replace the following:

   - _`<SCRAPE_LABEL>`: The label for the component, such as `custom_targets`.
     The label you use must be unique across all `prometheus.scrape` components in the same configuration file.
   - _`<TARGET_LIST>`_: A comma-delimited list of [Objects][] denoting the Prometheus target.
     Each object must conform to the following rules:

     * There must be an `__address__` key denoting the `HOST:PORT` of the target to collect metrics from.
     * To explicitly specify which protocol to use, set the `__scheme__` key to `"http"` or `"https"`.
       If the `__scheme__` key isn't provided, the protocol to use is inherited by the settings of the `prometheus.scrape` component. The default is `"http"`.
     * To explicitly specify which HTTP path to collect metrics from, set the `__metrics_path__` key to the HTTP path to use.
       If the `__metrics_path__` key isn't provided, the path to use is inherited by the settings of the `prometheus.scrape` component. The default is `"/metrics"`.
     * Add additional keys as desired to inject extra labels to collected metrics.
       Any label starting with two underscores (`__`) will be dropped prior to scraping.

   - _`<REMOTE_WRITE_LABEL>`_: The label for your existing `prometheus.remote_write` component.

The following example demonstrates configuring `prometheus.scrape` to collect metrics from a custom set of endpoints.

```river
prometheus.scrape "custom_targets" {
  targets = [
    {
      __address__ = "prometheus:9090",
    },
    {
      __address__ = "mimir:8080",
      __scheme__  = "https",
    },
    {
      __address__      = "custom-application:80",
      __metrics_path__ = "/custom-metrics–path",
    },
    {
      __address__ = "grafana-agent:12345",
      application = "grafana-agent",
      environment = "production",
    },
  ]

  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.default.receiver]
}

prometheus.remote_write "default" {
  endpoint {
    url = "http://localhost:9090/api/prom/push"
  }
}
```
