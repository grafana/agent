# Filtering Prometheus metrics

In this tutorial, you'll add a new component [prometheus.relabel]({{< ref "prometheus.relabel.md" >}}) using [relabel.river](../assets/flow_configs/relabel.river) to filter metrics. This tutorial uses the same base as [Collecting Prometheus metrics]({{< relref "./collecting-prometheus-metrics.md">}}).

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Run the example

The `prometheus.relabel` component is used to drop, add, or filter metrics.  Run the following: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grafana/agent/main/docs/sources/flow/tutorials/assets/runt.sh -O && bash ./runt.sh relabel.river`.

The `runt.sh` script does:

1. Downloads the configs necessary for Mimir, Grafana and the Grafana Agent. 
2. Downloads the docker image for Grafana Agent explicitly.
3. Runs the docker-compose up command to bring all the services up.


Allow the Grafana Agent to run for two minutes, then navigate to [Grafana](http://localhost:3000/explore?orgId=1&left=%5B%22now-1h%22,%22now%22,%22Mimir%22,%7B%22refId%22:%22A%22,%22instant%22:true,%22range%22:true,%22exemplar%22:true,%22expr%22:%22agent_build_info%7B%7D%22%7D%5D) page and the `service` label will be there with the `api_server` value.

## What's happening?

1. The Prometheus scraper is sending the metrics to the filter.
1. The filter is adding a new label named `service` with the value `api_server`.
1. The filter is then sending metrics to the remote_write endpoint. 

## Update the service value

Open the `relabel.river` file that was downloaded and change the name of the service to `api_server_v2`, then run `bash ./runt.sh relabel.river`. Allow the Grafana Agent to run for two minutes, then navigate to [Grafana](http://localhost:3000/explore?orgId=1&left=%5B%22now-1h%22,%22now%22,%22Mimir%22,%7B%22refId%22:%22A%22,%22instant%22:true,%22range%22:true,%22exemplar%22:true,%22expr%22:%22agent_build_info%7B%7D%22%7D%5D) page, and the new label will be updated. The old value `api_server` may still show up in the graph but hovering over the lines will show that that value stopped being scraped and was replaced with `api_server_v2`.
