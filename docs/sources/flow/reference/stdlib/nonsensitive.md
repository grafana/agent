# nonsensitive

`nonsensitive` converts a [secret][] value back into a string.

> **WARNING**: Only use `nonsensitive` when you are positive that the value
> being converted back to a string is not a sensitive value.
>
> Strings resulting from calls to `nonsensitive` will be displayed in plaintext
> in the UI and internal API calls.

## Examples

```
// Assuming `sensitive_value` is a secret:

> sensitive_value
(secret)
> nonsensitive(sensitive_value)
"Hello, world!"
```
