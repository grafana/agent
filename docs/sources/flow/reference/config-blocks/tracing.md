# tracing block

`tracing` is an optional configuration block used to customize how Grafana Agent
produces traces. `tracing` is specified without a label and can only be provided
once per configuration file.

## Example

```river
tracing {
  sampling_fraction = 0.1

  write_to = [otelcol.exporter.otlp.tempo.input]
}

otelcol.exporter.otlp "tempo" {
  // Send traces to a locally running Tempo without TLS enabled.
  client {
    endpoint = env("TEMPO_OTLP_ENDPOINT")

    tls {
      insecure = true
    }
  }
}
```

## Arguments

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`sampling_fraction` | `number` | Fraction of traces to keep. | `0.1` | no
`write_to` | `list(otelcol.Consumer)` | Inputs from `otelcol` components to send traces to. | `[]` | no

The `write_to` argument controls which components to send traces to for
processing. The elements in the array can be any `otelcol` component that
accept traces, including processors and exporters. When `write_to` is set
to an empty array `[]`, all traces are dropped.

> **NOTE**: Any traces generated before the `tracing` block has been evaluated,
> such as at the early start of the process' lifetime, are dropped.

The `sampling_fraction` argument controls what percentage of generated traces
should be sent to the consumers specified by `write_to`. When set to `1` or
greater, 100% of traces are kept. When set to `0` or lower, 0% of traces are
kept.

## Blocks

The following blocks are supported inside the definition of `tracing`:

Hierarchy | Block | Description | Required
--------- | ----- | ----------- | --------
sampler | [sampler][] | Define custom sampling on top of the base sampling fraction. | no
sampler > jaeger_remote | [jaeger_remote][] | Retrieve sampling information via a Jaeger remote sampler. | no

The `>` symbol indicates deeper levels of nesting. For example, `sampler >
jaeger_remote` refers to a `jaeger_remote` block defined inside an `sampler`
block.

[sampler]: #sampler-block
[jaeger_remote]: #jaeger_remote-block

### sampler block

The `sampler` block contains a definition of a custom sampler to use. The
`sampler` block supports no arguments and is controlled fully through inner
blocks.

It is invalid to define more than one sampler to use in the `sampler` block.

### jaeger_remote block

The `jaeger_remote` block configures the retrieval of sampling information
through a remote server that exposes Jaeger sampling strategies.

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`url` | `string` | URL to retrieve sampling strategies from. | `"http://127.0.0.1:5778/sampling"` | no
`max_operations` | `number` | Limit number of operations which can have custom sampling. | `256` | no
`refresh_interval` | `duration` | Frequency to poll the URL for new sampling strategies. | `"1m"` | no

The remote sampling strategies are retrieved from the URL specified by the
`url` argument, and polled for updates on a timer. The frequency for how often
polling occurs is controlled by the `refresh_interval` argument.

Requests to the remote sampling strategies server are made through an HTTP
`GET` request to the configured `url` argument. A `service=grafana-agent` query
parameter is always added to the URL to allow the server to respond with
service-specific strategies. The HTTP response body is read as JSON matching
the schema specified by Jaeger's [`strategies.json` file][Jaeger sampling
strategies].

The `max_operations` limits the amount of custom span names that can have
custom sampling rules. If the remote sampling strategy exceeds the limit,
sampling decisions fall back to the default sampler.
