# otelcol.processor.tail_sampling

{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/stability/beta.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT_VERSION>" >}}

`otelcol.processor.tail_sampling` samples traces based on a set of defined
policies. All spans for a given trace *must* be received by the same collector
instance for effective sampling decisions.

The `tail_sampling` component uses both soft and hard limits, where the hard limit
is always equal or larger than the soft limit. When memory usage goes above the
soft limit, the processor component drops data and returns errors to the
preceding components in the pipeline. When usage exceeds the hard
limit, the processor forces a garbage collection in order to try and free
memory. When usage is below the soft limit, no data is dropped and no forced
garbage collection is performed.

> **Note**: `otelcol.processor.tail_sampling` is a wrapper over the upstream
> OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib `tail_sampling` processor. Bug reports or feature
> requests will be redirected to the upstream repository, if necessary.

Multiple `otelcol.processor.tail_sampling` components can be specified by
giving them different labels.

## Usage

```river
otelcol.processor.tail_sampling "LABEL" {
  policy {
    ...
  }
  ...

  output {
    traces  = [...]
  }
}
```

## Arguments

`otelcol.processor.tail_sampling` supports the following arguments:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`decision_wait`               | `duration` | Wait time since the first span of a trace before making a sampling decision. | `"30s"` | no
`num_traces`                  | `int`      | Number of traces kept in memory. | `50000` | no
`expected_new_traces_per_sec` | `int`      | Expected number of new traces (helps in allocating data structures). | `0` | no

`decision_wait` determines the number of batches to maintain on a channel. Its value must convert to a number of seconds greater than zero.

`num_traces` determines the buffer size of the trace delete channel which is composed of trace ids. Increasing the number will increase the memory usage of the component while decreasing the number will lower the maximum amount of traces kept in memory.

`expected_new_traces_per_sec` determines the initial slice sizing of the current batch. A larger number will use more memory but be more efficient when adding traces to the batch.

`otelcol.processor.tail_sampling`:

### policy block

The `policy` block configures a sampling policy used by the component. At least one `policy` block is required.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`name` | `string` | The custom name given to the policy. | | yes
`type` | `string` | The valid policy type for this policy. | | yes

Each policy results in a decision, and the processor evaluates them to make a final decision:

- When there's an "inverted not sample" decision, the trace is not sampled.
- When there's a "sample" decision, the trace is sampled.
- When there's an "inverted sample" decision and no "not sample" decisions, the trace is sampled.
- In all other cases, the trace is *not* sampled.

An "inverted" decision is the one made based on the "invert_match" attribute, such as the one from the string tag policy.

### latency block

The `latency` block configures a policy of type `latency`. The policy samples based on the duration of the trace. The duration is determined by looking at the earliest start time and latest end time, without taking into consideration what happened in between.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`threshold_ms` | `number` | The latency threshold for sampling, in milliseconds. | | yes

### numeric_attribute block

The `numeric_attribute` block configures a policy of type `numeric_attribute`. The policy samples based on number attributes (resource and record).

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`key`       | `string` | Tag that the filter is matched against. | | yes
`min_value` | `number` | The minimum value of the attribute to be considered a match. | | yes
`max_value` | `number` | The maximum value of the attribute to be considered a match. | | yes

### probabilistic block

The `probabilistic` block configures a policy of type `probabilistic`. The policy samples a percentage of traces.

The following arguments are supported:

---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`sampling_percentage` | `number` | The percentage rate at which traces are sampled. | | yes
`hash_salt`           | `string` | See below. | | no

Use `hash_salt` to configure the hashing salts. This is important in scenarios where multiple layers of collectors
have different sampling rates. If multiple collectors use the same salt with different sampling rates, passing one
layer may pass the other even if the collectors have different sampling rates. Configuring different salts avoids that.

### status_code block

The `status_code` block configures a policy of type `status_code`. The policy samples based upon the status code.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`status_codes` | `list(string)` | Holds the configurable settings to create a status code filter sampling policy evaluator. | | yes

`status_codes` values must be "OK", "ERROR" or "UNSET".

### string_attribute block

The `string_attribute` block configures a policy of type `string_attribute`. The policy samples based on string attributes (resource and record) value matches. Both exact and regex value matches are supported.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`key`                    | `string`       | Tag that the filter is matched against. | | yes
`values`                 | `list(string)` | Set of values or regular expressions to use when matching against attribute values. | | yes
`enabled_regex_matching` | `bool`         | Determines whether to match attribute values by regexp string. | false | no
`cache_max_size`         | `string`       | The maximum number of attribute entries of Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache that stores the matched result from the regular expressions defined in `values.` | | no
`invert_match`           | `bool`         | Indicates that values or regular expressions must not match against attribute values. | false | no

### rate_limiting block

The `rate_limiting` block configures a policy of type `rate_limiting`. The policy samples based on rate.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`spans_per_second` | `number` | Sets the maximum number of spans that can be processed each second. | | yes

### span_count block

The `span_count` block configures a policy of type `span_count`. The policy samples based on the minimum number of spans within a batch. If all traces within the batch have fewer spans than the threshold, the batch is not sampled.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`min_spans` | `number` | Minimum number of spans in a trace. | | yes

### boolean_attribute block

`key`   | `string` | Attribute key to match against. | | yes
`value` | `bool` | The bool value (`true` or `false`) to use when matching against attribute values. | | yes

### ottl_condition block

The `ottl_condition` block configures a policy of type `ottl_condition`. The policy samples based on a given boolean 
[OTTL](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/ottl) condition (span and span event).

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`error_mode` | `string` | Error handling if OTTL conditions fail to evaluate. | | yes
`span`       | `list(string)` | OTTL conditions for spans. | `[]` | no
`spanevent`  | `list(string)` | OTTL conditions for span events. | `[]` | no

The supported values for `error_mode` are:
* `ignore`: Errors cause evaluation to continue to the next statement.
* `propagate`: Errors cause the evaluation to be false and an error is returned.

At least one of `span` or `spanevent` should be specified. Both `span` and `spanevent` can also be specified.

### trace_state block

The `trace_state` block configures a policy of type `trace_state`. The policy samples based on TraceState value matches.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`key`                    | `string`       | Tag that the filter is matched against. | | yes

### and block

The `and` block configures a policy of type `and`. The policy samples based on multiple policies by creating an `and` policy.

### and_sub_policy block

The `and_sub_policy` block configures a sampling policy used by the `and` block. At least one `and_sub_policy` block is required inside an `and` block.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`name` | `string` | The custom name given to the policy. | | yes
`type` | `string` | The valid policy type for this policy. | | yes

### composite block

The `composite` block configures a policy of type `composite`. This policy samples based on a combination of the above samplers, with ordering and rate allocation per sampler. Rate allocation allocates certain percentages of spans per policy order. For example, if `max_total_spans_per_second` is set to 100, then `rate_allocation` is set as follows:

1. test-composite-policy-1 = 50% of max_total_spans_per_second = 50 spans_per_second
2. test-composite-policy-2 = 25% of max_total_spans_per_second = 25 spans_per_second
3. To ensure remaining capacity is filled, use always_sample as one of the policies.

### composite_sub_policy block

The `composite_sub_policy` block configures a sampling policy used by the `composite` block. At least one`composite_sub_policy` block is required inside a `composite` block.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`name` | `string` | The custom name given to the policy. | | yes
`type` | `string` | The valid policy type for this policy. | | yes
