# pyroscope.write

{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/stability/beta.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT_VERSION>" >}}

`pyroscope.write` receives performance profiles from other components and forwards them
to a series of user-supplied endpoints using [Pyroscope' Push API](/oss/pyroscope/).

Multiple `pyroscope.write` components can be specified by giving them
different labels.

## Usage

```river
pyroscope.write "LABEL" {
  endpoint {
    url = PYROSCOPE_URL

    ...
  }

  ...
}
```

## Arguments

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`external_labels` | `map(string)` | Labels to add to profiles sent over the network. | | no

## Blocks

The following blocks are supported inside the definition of
`pyroscope.write`:

Hierarchy | Block | Description | Required
--------- | ----- | ----------- | --------
endpoint | [endpoint][] | Location to send profiles to. | no
endpoint > basic_auth | [basic_auth][] | Configure basic_auth for authenticating to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > authorization | [authorization][] | Configure generic authorization to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > oauth2 | [oauth2][] | Configure OAuth2 for authenticating to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > oauth2 > tls_config | [tls_config][] | Configure TLS settings for connecting to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > tls_config | [tls_config][] | Configure TLS settings for connecting to the endpoint. | no

The `>` symbol indicates deeper levels of nesting. For example, `endpoint >
basic_auth` refers to a `basic_auth` block defined inside an
`endpoint` block.

[endpoint]: #endpoint-block
[basic_auth]: #basic_auth-block
[authorization]: #authorization-block
[oauth2]: #oauth2-block
[tls_config]: #tls_config-block

### endpoint block

The `endpoint` block describes a single location to send profiles to. Multiple
`endpoint` blocks can be provided to send profiles to multiple locations.

The following arguments are supported:

Name                     | Type                | Description                                                   | Default   | Required
-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------

`name`                   | `string`            | Optional name to identify the endpoint in metrics.            |           | no
`remote_timeout`         | `duration`          | Timeout for requests made to the URL.                         | `"10s"`   | no
`headers`                | `map(string)`       | Extra headers to deliver with the request.                    |           | no
`min_backoff_period`     | `duration`          | Initial backoff time between retries.                         | `"500ms"` | no
`max_backoff_period`     | `duration`          | Maximum backoff time between retries.                         | `"5m"`    | no
`max_backoff_retries`    | `int`               | Maximum number of retries. 0 to retry infinitely.             | 10        | no

`enable_http2`           | `bool`              | Whether HTTP2 is supported for requests.                      | `true`    | no
`follow_redirects`       | `bool`              | Whether redirects returned by the server should be followed.  | `true`    | no
`proxy_url`              | `string`            | HTTP proxy to send requests through.                          |           | no
`no_proxy`               | `string`            | Comma-separated list of IP addresses, CIDR notations, and domain names to exclude from proxying. | | no
`proxy_from_environment` | `bool`              | Use the proxy URL indicated by environment variables.         | `false` | no
`proxy_connect_header`   | `map(list(secret))` | Specifies headers to send to proxies during CONNECT requests. |         | no

 At most, one of the following can be provided:
 - [`bearer_token` argument][endpoint].
 - [`bearer_token_file` argument][endpoint].
 - [`basic_auth` block][basic_auth].
 - [`authorization` block][authorization].
 - [`oauth2` block][oauth2].

{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/reference/components/http-client-proxy-config-description.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT_VERSION>" >}}

When multiple `endpoint` blocks are provided, profiles are concurrently forwarded to all
configured locations.

### basic_auth block

### authorization block

{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/reference/components/authorization-block.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT_VERSION>" >}}

### oauth2 block

{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/reference/components/oauth2-block.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT_VERSION>" >}}

### tls_config block

## Exported fields

The following fields are exported and can be referenced by other components:

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
`receiver` | `receiver` | A value that other components can use to send profiles to.

## Component health

`pyroscope.write` is only reported as unhealthy if given an invalid
configuration. In those cases, exported fields are kept at their last healthy
values.

## Debug information

`pyroscope.write` does not expose any component-specific debug
information.

## Example

```river
pyroscope.write "staging" {
  // Send metrics to a locally running Pyroscope instance.
  endpoint {
    url = "http://pyroscope:4100"
    headers = {
      "X-Scope-OrgID" = "squad-1",
    }
  }
  external_labels = {
    "env" = "staging",
  }
}


pyroscope.scrape "default" {
  targets = [
    {"__address__" = "pyroscope:4100", "service_name"="pyroscope"},
    {"__address__" = "agent:12345", "service_name"="agent"},
  ]
  forward_to = [pyroscope.write.staging.receiver]
}
```
