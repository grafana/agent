# loki.process

`loki.process` receives log entries from other loki components, applies one or
more processing _stages_, and forwards the results to the list of receivers
in the component's arguments.

A stage is a multi-purpose tool that can parse, transform, and filter log
entries before they're passed to a downstream component. These stages are
applied to each log entry in order of their appearance in the configuration
file. All stages within a `loki.process` block have access to the log entry's
label set, the log line, the log timestamp, as well as a shared map of
'extracted' values so that the results of one stage can be used in a subsequent
one.

Multiple `loki.process` components can be specified by giving them
different labels.

## Usage

```river
loki.process "LABEL" {
  forward_to = RECEIVER_LIST

  stage.STAGENAME {
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

## Arguments

`loki.process` supports the following arguments:

| Name         | Type                 | Description                                    | Default | Required |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |

### stage.cri block

The `stage.cri` inner block enables a predefined pipeline which reads log lines using
the CRI logging format.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name                             | Type       | Description                                                          | Default        | Required |
| -------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| `max_partial_lines`              | `number`   | Maximum number of partial lines to hold in memory.                   | `100`          | no       |
| `max_partial_line_size`          | `number`   | Maximum number of characters which a partial line can have.          | `0`            | no       |
| `max_partial_line_size_truncate` | `bool`     | Truncate partial lines that are longer than `max_partial_line_size`. | `false`        | no       |

`max_partial_line_size` is only taken into account if 
`max_partial_line_size_truncate` is set to `true`.

```river
stage.cri {}
```

CRI specifies log lines as single space-delimited values with the following
components:

* `time`: The timestamp string of the log
* `stream`: Either `stdout` or `stderr`
* `flags`: CRI flags including `F` or `P`
* `log`: The contents of the log line

Given the following log line, the subsequent key-value pairs are created in the
shared map of extracted data:
```
"2019-04-30T02:12:41.8443515Z stdout F message"

content: message
stream: stdout
timestamp: 2019-04-30T02:12:41.8443515
```

### stage.decolorize block

The `stage.decolorize` strips ANSI color codes from the log lines, thus making
it easier to parse logs further.

The `stage.decolorize` block does not support any arguments or inner blocks, so 
it is always empty.

```river
stage.decolorize {}
```

`stage.decolorize` turns each line having a color code into a non-colored one, 
for example:

```
[2022-11-04 22:17:57.811] \033[0;32http\033[0m: GET /_health (0 ms) 204
```

is turned into

```
[2022-11-04 22:17:57.811] http: GET /_health (0 ms) 204
```

### stage.docker block

The `stage.docker` inner block enables a predefined pipeline which reads log lines in
the standard format of Docker log files.

The `stage.docker` block does not support any arguments or inner blocks, so it is
always empty.

```river
stage.docker {}
```

Docker log entries are formatted as JSON with the following keys:

* `log`: The content of log line
* `stream`: Either `stdout` or `stderr`
* `time`: The timestamp string of the log line

Given the following log line, the subsequent key-value pairs are created in the
shared map of extracted data:

```
{"log":"log message\n","stream":"stderr","time":"2019-04-30T02:12:41.8443515Z"}

output: log message\n
stream: stderr
timestamp: 2019-04-30T02:12:41.8443515
```

### stage.drop block

The `stage.drop` inner block configures a filtering stage that drops log entries
based on several options. If multiple options are provided, they're treated
as AND clauses and must _all_ be true for the log entry to be dropped.
To drop entries with an OR clause, specify multiple `drop` blocks in sequence.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name                  | Type       | Description                                                                                                         | Default        | Required |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| `source`              | `string`   | Name from extracted data to parse. If empty or not defined, it uses the log message.                                | `""`           | no       |
| `expression`          | `string`   | A valid RE2 regular expression.                                                                                     | `""`           | no       |
| `value`               | `string`   | If both `source` and `value` are specified, the stage drops lines where `value` exactly matches the source content. | `""`           | no       |
| `older_than`          | `duration` | If specified, the stage drops lines whose timestamp is older than the current time minus this duration.             | `""`           | no       |
| `longer_than`         | `string`   | If specified, the stage drops lines whose size exceeds the configured value.                                        | `""`           | no       |
| `drop_counter_reason` | `string`   | A custom reason to report for dropped lines.                                                                        | `"drop_stage"` | no       |

The `expression` field needs to be a RE2 regex string. If `source` is empty or
not provided, the regex attempts to match the log line itself. If source is
provided, the regex attempts to match the corresponding value from the
extracted map.

The `value` field can only work with values from the extracted map, and must be
specified together with `source`. Entries are dropped when there is an exact
match between the two.

Whenever an entry is dropped, the metric `loki_process_dropped_lines_total`
is incremented. By default, the reason label is `"drop_stage"`, but you can
provide a custom label using the `drop_counter_reason` argument.

The following stage drops log entries that contain the word `debug` _and_ are
longer than 1KB.

```river
stage.drop {
    expression  = ".*debug.*"
    longer_than = "1KB"
}
```

On the following example, we define multiple `drop` blocks so `loki.process`
drops entries that are either 24h or older, are longer than 8KB, _or_ the
extracted value of 'app' is equal to foo.

```river
stage.drop {
    older_than          = "24h"
    drop_counter_reason = "too old"
}

stage.drop {
    longer_than         = "8KB"
    drop_counter_reason = "too long"
}

stage.drop {
    source = "app"
    value  = "foo"
}
```

### stage.json block

The `stage.json` inner block configures a JSON processing stage that parses incoming
log lines or previously extracted values as JSON and uses
[JMESPath expressions](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html) to extract new
values from them.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name             | Type          | Description                                            | Default | Required |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `expressions`    | `map(string)` | Key-value pairs of JMESPath expressions.               |         | yes      |
| `source`         | `string`      | Source of the data to parse as JSON.                   | `""`    | no       |
| `drop_malformed` | `bool`        | Drop lines whose input cannot be parsed as valid JSON. | `false` | no       |

When configuring a JSON stage, the `source` field defines the source of data to
parse as JSON. By default, this is the log line itself, but it can also be a
previously extracted value.

The `expressions` field is the set of key-value pairs of JMESPath expressions to
run. The map key defines the name with which the data is extracted, while the
map value is the expression used to populate the value.

Here's a given log line and two JSON stages to run.

```river
{"log":"log message\n","extra":"{\"user\":\"agent\"}"}

loki.process "username" {
  stage.json {
      expressions = {output = "log", extra = ""}
  }

  stage.json {
      source      = "extra"
      expressions = {username = "user"}
  }
}
```

In this example, the first stage uses the log line as the source and populates
these values in the shared map. An empty expression means using the same value
as the key (so `extra="extra"`).
```
output: log message\n
extra: {"user": "agent"}
```

The second stage uses the value in `extra` as the input and appends the
following key-value pair to the set of extracted data.
```
username: agent
```

### stage.label_drop block

The `stage.label_drop` inner block configures a processing stage that drops labels
from incoming log entries.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name     | Type           | Description                                 | Default | Required |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `values` | `list(string)` | Configures a `label_drop` processing stage. | `{}`    | no       |

```river
stage.label_drop {
    values = [ "kubernetes_node_name", "kubernetes_namespace" ]
}
```

### stage.label_keep block

The `stage.label_keep` inner block configures a processing stage that filters the
label set of an incoming log entry down to a subset.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name     | Type           | Description                                 | Default | Required |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `values` | `list(string)` | Configures a `label_keep` processing stage. | `{}`    | no       |


```river
stage.label_keep {
    values = [ "kubernetes_pod_name", "kubernetes_pod_container_name" ]
}
```

### stage.labels block

The `stage.labels` inner block configures a labels processing stage that can read
data from the extracted values map and set new labels on incoming log entries.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name     | Type          | Description                             | Default | Required |
| -------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `values` | `map(string)` | Configures a `labels` processing stage. | `{}`    | no       |

In a labels stage, the map's keys define the label to set and the values are
how to look them up. If the value is empty, it is inferred to be the same as
the key.

```river
stage.labels {
    values = {
      env  = "",         // Sets up an 'env' label, based on the 'env' extracted value.
      user = "username", // Sets up a 'user' label, based on the 'username' extracted value.
    }
}
```

### stage.structured_metadata block

The `stage.structured_metadata` inner block configures a stage that can read
data from the extracted values map and add them to log entries as structured metadata.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name     | Type          | Description                                                                 | Default | Required |
| -------- | ------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------- | -------- |
| `values` | `map(string)` | Specifies the list of labels to add from extracted values map to log entry. | `{}`    | no       |

In a structured_metadata stage, the map's keys define the label to set and the values are
how to look them up. If the value is empty, it is inferred to be the same as
the key.

```river
stage.structured_metadata {
    values = {
      env  = "",         // Sets up an 'env' property to structured metadata, based on the 'env' extracted value.
      user = "username", // Sets up a 'user' property to structured metadata, based on the 'username' extracted value.
    }
}
```

### stage.limit block

The `stage.limit` inner block configures a rate-limiting stage that throttles logs
based on several options.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name                  | Type     | Description                                                                      | Default | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `rate`                | `number` | The maximum rate of lines per second that the stage forwards.                    |         | yes      |
| `burst`               | `number` | The maximum number of burst lines that the stage forwards.                       |         | yes      |
| `by_label_name`       | `string` | The label to use when rate-limiting on a label name.                             | `""`    | no       |
| `drop`                | `bool`   | Whether to discard or backpressure lines that exceed the rate limit.             | `false` | no       |
| `max_distinct_labels` | `number` | The number of unique values to keep track of when rate-limiting `by_label_name`. | `10000` | no       |

The rate limiting is implemented as a "token bucket" of size `burst`, initially
full and refilled at `rate` tokens per second. Each received log entry consumes one token from the bucket. When `drop` is set to true, incoming entries
that exceed the rate-limit are dropped, otherwise they are queued until
more tokens are available.

```river
stage.limit {
    rate  = 5
    burst = 10
}
```

If `by_label_name` is set, then `drop` must be set to `true`. This enables the
stage to rate-limit not by the number of lines but by the number of labels.

The following example rate-limits entries from each unique `namespace` value
independently. Any entries without the `namespace` label are not rate-limited.
The stage keeps track of up to `max_distinct_labels` unique
values, defaulting at 10000.
```river
stage.limit {
    rate  = 10
    burst = 10
    drop  = true

    by_label_name = "namespace"
}
```

### stage.logfmt block

The `stage.logfmt` inner block configures a processing stage that reads incoming log
lines as logfmt and extracts values from them.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name      | Type          | Description                                  | Default | Required |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `mapping` | `map(string)` | Key-value pairs of logmft fields to extract. |         | yes      |
| `source`  | `string`      | Source of the data to parse as logfmt.       | `""`    | no       |


The `source` field defines the source of data to parse as logfmt. When `source`
is missing or empty, the stage parses the log line itself, but it can also be
used to parse a previously extracted value.

This stage uses the [go-logfmt](https://github.com/go-logfmt/logfmt)
unmarshaler, so that numeric or boolean types are unmarshalled into their
correct form. The stage does not perform any other type conversions. If the
extracted value is a complex type, it is treated as a string.

Let's see how this works on the following log line and stages.

```
time=2012-11-01T22:08:41+00:00 app=loki level=WARN duration=125 message="this is a log line" extra="user=foo"

stage.logfmt {
    mapping = { "extra" = "" }
}

stage.logfmt {
    mapping = { "username" = "user" }
    source  = "extra"
}
```

The first stage parses the log line itself and inserts the `extra` key in the
set of extracted data, with the value of `user=foo`.

The second stage parses the contents of `extra` and appends the `username: foo`
key-value pair to the set of extracted data.

### stage.match block

The `stage.match` inner block configures a filtering stage that can conditionally
either apply a nested set of processing stages or drop an entry when a log
entry matches a configurable LogQL stream selector and filter expressions.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name                  | Type     | Description                                                                                           | Default         | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| `selector`            | `string` | The LogQL stream selector and filter expressions to use.                                              |                 | yes      |
| `pipeline_name`       | `string` | A custom name to use for the nested pipeline.                                                         | `""`            | no       |
| `action`              | `string` | The action to take when the selector matches the log line. Supported values are `"keep"` and `"drop"` | `"keep"`        | no       |
| `drop_counter_reason` | `string` | A custom reason to report for dropped lines.                                                          | `"match_stage"` | no       |

The `stage.match` block supports a number of `stage.*` inner blocks, like the top-level
block. These are used to construct the nested set of stages to run if the
selector matches the labels and content of the log entries. It supports all the
same `stage.NAME` blocks as the in the top level of the loki.process component.


If the specified action is `"drop"`, the metric
`loki_process_dropped_lines_total` is incremented with every line dropped.
By default, the reason label is `"match_stage"`, but a custom reason can be
provided by using the `drop_counter_reason` argument.

Let's see this in action, with the following log lines and stages
```
{ "time":"2023-01-18T17:08:41+00:00", "app":"foo", "component": ["parser","type"], "level" : "WARN", "message" : "app1 log line" }
{ "time":"2023-01-18T17:08:42+00:00", "app":"bar", "component": ["parser","type"], "level" : "ERROR", "message" : "foo noisy error" }

stage.json {
    expressions = { "appname" = "app" }
}

stage.labels {
    values = { "applbl" = "appname" }
}

stage.match {
    selector = "{applbl=\"foo\"}"

    stage.json {
        expressions = { "msg" = "message" }
    }
}

stage.match {
    selector = "{applbl=\"qux\"}"
    stage.json {
        expressions = { "msg" = "msg" }
    }
}

stage.match {
    selector = "{applbl=\"bar\"} |~ \".*noisy error.*\""
    action   = "drop"

    drop_counter_reason = "discard_noisy_errors"
}

stage.output {
    source = "msg"
}
```

The first two stages parse the log lines as JSON, decode the `app` value into
the shared extracted map as `appname`, and use its value as the `applbl` label.

The third stage uses the LogQL selector to only execute the nested stages on
lines where the `applbl="foo"`. So, for the first line, the nested JSON stage
adds `msg="app1 log line"` into the extracted map.

The fourth stage uses the LogQL selector to only execute on lines where
`applbl="qux"`; that means it won't match any of the input, and the nested
JSON stage does not run.

The fifth stage drops entries from lines where `applbl` is set to 'bar' and the
line contents matches the regex `.*noisy error.*`. It also increments the
`loki_process_dropped_lines_total` metric with a label
`drop_counter_reason="discard_noisy_errors"`.

The final output stage changes the contents of the log line to be the value of
`msg` from the extracted map. In this case, the first log entry's content is
changed to `app1 log line`.

### stage.metrics block

The `stage.metrics` inner block configures stage that allows to define and
update metrics based on values from the shared extracted map. The created
metrics are available at the Agent's root /metrics endpoint.

The `stage.metrics` block does not support any arguments and is only configured via
a number of nested inner `metric.*` blocks, one for each metric that should be
generated.

The following blocks are supported inside the definition of `stage.metrics`:

| Hierarchy        | Block                | Description                   | Required |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| metric.counter   | [metric.counter][]   | Defines a `counter` metric.   | no       |
| metric.gauge     | [metric.gauge][]     | Defines a `gauge` metric.     | no       |
| metric.histogram | [metric.histogram][] | Defines a `histogram` metric. | no       |

[metric.counter]: #metriccounter-block
[metric.gauge]: #metricgauge-block
[metric.histogram]: #metrichistogram-block


#### metric.counter block
Defines a metric whose value only goes up.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name                | Type       | Description                                                                                              | Default                  | Required |
| ------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| `name`              | `string`   | The metric name.                                                                                         |                          | yes      |
| `action`            | `string`   | The action to take. Valid actions are `set`, `inc`, `dec`,` add`, or `sub`.                              |                          | yes      |
| `description`       | `string`   | The metric's description and help text.                                                                  | `""`                     | no       |
| `source`            | `string`   | Key from the extracted data map to use for the metric. Defaults to the metric name.                      | `""`                     | no       |
| `prefix`            | `string`   | The prefix to the metric name.                                                                           | `"loki_process_custom_"` | no       |
| `max_idle_duration`     | `duration` | Maximum amount of time to wait until the metric is marked as 'stale' and removed.                        | `"5m"`                   | no       |
| `value`             | `string`   | If set, the metric only changes if `source` exactly matches the `value`.                                 | `""`                     | no       |
| `match_all`         | `bool`     | If set to true, all log lines are counted, without attemptng to match the `source` to the extracted map. | `false`                  | no       |
| `count_entry_bytes` | `bool`     | If set to true, counts all log lines bytes.                                                              | `false`                  | no       |

A counter cannot set both `match_all` to true _and_ a `value`.
A counter cannot set `count_entry_bytes` without also setting `match_all=true`
_or_ `action=add`.
The valid `action` values are `inc` and `add`. The `inc` action increases the
metric value by 1 for each log line that passed the filter. The `add` action
converts the extracted value to a positive float and adds it to the metric.


#### metric.gauge block
Defines a gauge metric whose value can go up or down.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name            | Type       | Description                                                                         | Default                  | Required |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| `name`          | `string`   | The metric name.                                                                    |                          | yes      |
| `action`        | `string`   | The action to take. Valid actions are `inc` and `add`.                              |                          | yes      |
| `description`   | `string`   | The metric's description and help text.                                             | `""`                     | no       |
| `source`        | `string`   | Key from the extracted data map to use for the metric. Defaults to the metric name. | `""`                     | no       |
| `prefix`        | `string`   | The prefix to the metric name.                                                      | `"loki_process_custom_"` | no       |
| `max_idle_duration` | `duration` | Maximum amount of time to wait until the metric is marked as 'stale' and removed.   | `"5m"`                   | no       |
| `value`         | `string`   | If set, the metric only changes if `source` exactly matches the `value`.            | `""`                     | no       |


The valid `action` values are `inc`, `dec`, `set`, `add`, or `sub`.
`inc` and `dec` increment and decrement the metric's value by 1 respectively.
If `set`, `add, or `sub` is chosen, the extracted value must be convertible
to a positive float and is set, added to, or subtracted from the metric's value.


#### metric.histogram block
Defines a histogram metric whose values are recorded in predefined buckets.


The following arguments are supported:

| Name            | Type          | Description                                                                         | Default                  | Required |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| `name`          | `string`      | The metric name.                                                                    |                          | yes      |
| `buckets`       | `list(float)` | The action to take. Valid actions are `set`, `inc`, `dec`,` add`, or `sub`.         |                          | yes      |
| `description`   | `string`      | The metric's description and help text.                                             | `""`                     | no       |
| `source`        | `string`      | Key from the extracted data map to use for the metric. Defaults to the metric name. | `""`                     | no       |
| `prefix`        | `string`      | The prefix to the metric name.                                                      | `"loki_process_custom_"` | no       |
| `max_idle_duration` | `duration`    | Maximum amount of time to wait until the metric is marked as 'stale' and removed.   | `"5m"`                   | no       |
| `value`         | `string`      | If set, the metric only changes if `source` exactly matches the `value`.            | `""`                     | no       |

#### metrics behavior

If `value` is not present, all incoming log entries match.

Label values on created metrics can be dynamic, which can cause exported
metrics to explode in cardinality or go stale, for example, when a stream stops
receiving new logs. To prevent unbounded growth of the `/metrics` endpoint, any
metrics which have not been updated within `max_idle_duration` are removed. The
`max_idle_duration` must be greater or equal to `"1s"`, and it defaults to `"5m"`.

The metric values extracted from the log data are internally converted to
floats. The supported values are the following:

* integer
* floating point number
* string - Two types of string format are supported:
    * Strings that represent floating point numbers, for example, "0.804" is converted to 0.804.
    * Duration format strings. Valid time units are “ns”, “us”, “ms”, “s”, “m”, “h”. A value in this format is converted to a floating point number of seconds, for example, "0.5ms" is converted to 0.0005.
* boolean:
    * true is converted to 1.
    * false is converted to 0.

The following pipeline creates a counter which increments every time any log line is received by using the `match_all` parameter. The pipeline creates a second counter which adds the byte size of these log lines by using the `count_entry_bytes` parameter.

These two metrics disappear after 24 hours if no new entries are received, to avoid building up metrics which no longer serve any use. These two metrics are a good starting point to track the volume of log streams in both the number of entries and their byte size, to identify sources of high-volume or high-cardinality data.
```river
stage.metrics {
    metric.counter {
        name        = "log_lines_total"
        description = "total number of log lines"
        prefix      = "my_custom_tracking_"

        match_all         = true
        action            = "inc"
        max_idle_duration = "24h"
    }
}
stage.metrics {
    metric.counter {
        name        = "log_bytes_total"
        description = "total bytes of log lines"
        prefix      = "my_custom_tracking_"

        match_all         = true
        count_entry_bytes = true
        action            = "add"
        max_idle_duration = "24h"
    }
}
```

Here, the first stage uses a regex to extract text in the format
`order_status=<string>` in the log line.
The second stage, defines a counter which increments the `successful_orders_total` and `failed_orders_total` based on the previously extracted values.

```river
stage.regex {
    expression = "^.* order_status=(?P<order_status>.*?) .*$"
}
stage.metrics {
    metric.counter {
        name        = "successful_orders_total"
        description = "successful orders"
        source      = "order_status"
        value       = "success"
        action      = "inc"
    }
}
stage.metrics {
    metric.counter {
        name        = "failed_orders_total"
        description = "failed orders"
        source      = "order_status"
        value       = "fail"
        action      = "inc"
    }
}
```

In this example, the first stage extracts text in the format of `retries=<value>`, from the log line. The second stage creates a gauge whose current metric value is increased by the number extracted from the retries field.

```river
stage.regex {
    expression = "^.* retries=(?P<retries>\\d+) .*$"
}
stage.metrics {
    metric.gauge {
        name        = "retries_total"
        description = "total_retries"
        source      = "retries"
        action      = "add"
    }
}
```

The following example shows a histogram that reads `response_time` from the extracted
map and places it into a bucket, both increasing the count of the bucket and
the sum for that particular bucket:

```river
stage.metrics {
    metric.histogram {
        name        = "http_response_time_seconds"
        description = "recorded response times"
        source      = "response_time"
        buckets     = [0.001,0.0025,0.005,0.010,0.025,0.050]
    }
}
```

### stage.multiline block

The `stage.multiline` inner block merges multiple lines into a single block before
passing it on to the next stage in the pipeline.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name            | Type       | Description                                        | Default | Required |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `firstline`     | `string`   | Name from extracted data to use for the log entry. |         | yes      |
| `max_wait_time` | `duration` | The maximum time to wait for a multiline block.    | `"3s"`  | no       |
| `max_lines`     | `number`   | The maximum number of lines a block can have.      | `128`   | no       |


A new block is identified by the RE2 regular expression passed in `firstline`.


Any line that does _not_ match the expression is considered to be part of the
block of the previous match. If no new logs arrive with `max_wait_time`, the
block is sent on. The `max_lines` field defines the maximum number of lines a
block can have. If this is exceeded, a new block is started.

Let's see how this works in practice with an example stage and a stream of log
entries from a Flask web service.

```
stage.multiline {
    firstline     = "^\\[\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2} \\d{1,2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2}\\]"
    max_wait_time = "10s"
}

[2023-01-18 17:41:21] "GET /hello HTTP/1.1" 200 -
[2023-01-18 17:41:25] ERROR in app: Exception on /error [GET]

[2023-01-18 17:42:29] "GET /hello HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

All 'blocks' that form log entries of separate web requests start with a
timestamp in square brackets. The stage detects this with the regular
expression in `firstline` to collapse all lines of the traceback into a single
block and thus a single Loki log entry.

### stage.output block

The `stage.output` inner block configures a processing stage that reads from the
extracted map and changes the content of the log entry that is forwarded
to the next component.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name     | Type     | Description                                        | Default | Required |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `source` | `string` | Name from extracted data to use for the log entry. |         | yes      |


Let's see how this works for the following log line and three-stage pipeline:

```
{"user": "John Doe", "message": "hello, world!"}

stage.json {
    expressions = { "user" = "user", "message" = "message" }
}

stage.labels {
    values = { "user" = "user" }
}

stage.output {
    source = "message"
}
```

The first stage extracts the following key-value pairs into the shared map:
```
user: John Doe
message: hello, world!
```

Then, the second stage adds `user="John Doe"` to the label set of the log
entry, and the final output stage changes the log line from the original
JSON to `hello, world!`.

### stage.pack block

The `stage.pack` inner block configures a transforming stage that replaces the log
entry with a JSON object that embeds extracted values and labels with it.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name               | Type           | Description                                                                     | Default | Required |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `labels`           | `list(string)` | The values from the extracted data and labels to pack with the log entry.       |         | yes      |
| `ingest_timestamp` | `bool`         | Whether to replace the log entry timestamp with the time the `pack` stage runs. | `true   | no       |

This stage lets you embed extracted values and labels together with the log
line, by packing them into a JSON object. The original message is stored under
the `_entry` key, and all other keys retain their values. This is useful in
cases where you _do_ want to keep a certain label or metadata, but you don't
want it to be indexed as a label due to high cardinality.

The querying capabilities of Loki make it easy to still access this data so it can
be filtered and aggregated at query time.

For example, consider the following log entry:
```
log_line: "something went wrong"
labels:   { "level" = "error", "env" = "dev", "user_id" = "f8fas0r" }
```

and this processing stage:
```river
stage.pack {
    labels = ["env", "user_id"]
}
```

The stage transforms the log entry into the following JSON object, where the two
embedded labels are removed from the original log entry:
```json
{
  "_entry": "something went wrong",
  "env": "dev",
  "user_id": "f8fas0r",
}
```

At query time, Loki's [`unpack` parser](/docs/loki/latest/logql/log_queries/#unpack)
can be used to access these embedded labels and replace the log line with the
original one stored in the `_entry` field automatically.

When combining several log streams to use with the `pack` stage, you can set
`ingest_timestamp` to true to avoid interlaced timestamps and
out-of-order ingestion issues.

### stage.regex block

The `stage.regex` inner block configures a processing stage that parses log lines
using regular expressions and uses named capture groups for adding data into
the shared extracted map of values.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name         | Type     | Description                                                        | Default | Required |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `expression` | `string` | A valid RE2 regular expression. Each capture group must be named.  |         | yes      |
| `source`     | `string` | Name from extracted data to parse. If empty, uses the log message. | `""`    | no       |


The `expression` field needs to be a RE2 regex string. Every matched capture
group is added to the extracted map, so it must be named like: `(?P<name>re)`.
The name of the capture group is then used as the key in the extracted map for
the matched value.

Because of how River strings work, any backslashes in `expression` must be
escaped with a double backslash; for example `"\\w"` or `"\\S+"`.

If the `source` is empty or missing, then the stage parses the log line itself.
If it's set, the stage parses a previously extracted value with the same name.

Given the following log line and regex stage, the extracted values are shown
below:

```
2019-01-01T01:00:00.000000001Z stderr P i'm a log message!

stage.regex {
    expression = "^(?s)(?P<time>\\S+?) (?P<stream>stdout|stderr) (?P<flags>\\S+?) (?P<content>.*)$"
}

time: 2019-01-01T01:00:00.000000001Z,
stream: stderr,
flags: P,
content: i'm a log message
```

On the other hand, if the `source` value is set, then the regex is applied to
the value stored in the shared map under that name.

Let's see what happens when the following log line is put through this
two-stage pipeline:
```
{"timestamp":"2022-01-01T01:00:00.000000001Z"}

stage.json {
    expressions = { time = "timestamp" }
}
stage.regex {
    expression = "^(?P<year>\\d+)"
    source     = "time"
}
```

The first stage adds the following key-value pair into the extracted map:
```
time: 2022-01-01T01:00:00.000000001Z
```

Then, the regex stage parses the value for time from the shared values and
appends the subsequent key-value pair back into the extracted values map:
```
year: 2022
```

### stage.replace block

The `stage.replace` inner block configures a stage that parses a log line using a
regular expression and replaces the log line contents. Named capture groups in
the regex also support adding data into the shared extracted map.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name         | Type     | Description                                                     | Default | Required |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `expression` | `string` | Name from extracted data to use for the log entry.              |         | yes      |
| `source`     | `string` | Source of the data to parse. If empty, it uses the log message. |         | no       |
| `replace`    | `string` | Value replaced by the capture group.                            |         | no       |


The `source` field defines the source of data to parse using `expression`. When
`source` is missing or empty, the stage parses the log line itself, but it can
also be used to parse a previously extracted value. The replaced value is
assigned back to the `source` key.

The `expression` must be a valid RE2 regex. Every named capture group
`(?P<name>re)` is set into the extracted map with its name.

Because of how River treats backslashes in double-quoted strings, note that all
backslashes in a regex expression must be escaped like `"\\w*"`.

Let's see how this works with the following log line and stage. Since `source`
is omitted, the replacement occurs  on the log line itself.

```
2023-01-01T01:00:00.000000001Z stderr P i'm a log message who has sensitive information with password xyz!

stage.replace {
    expression = "password (\\S+)"
    replace    = "*****"
}
```

The log line is transformed to
```
2023-01-01T01:00:00.000000001Z stderr P i'm a log message who has sensitive information with password *****!
```

If `replace` is empty, then the captured value is omitted instead.

In the following example, `source` is defined.
```
{"time":"2023-01-01T01:00:00.000000001Z", "level": "info", "msg":"11.11.11.11 - \"POST /loki/api/push/ HTTP/1.1\" 200 932 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0\"}

stage.json {
    expressions = { "level" = "", "msg" = "" }
}

stage.replace {
    expression = "\\S+ - \"POST (\\S+) .*"
    source     = "msg"
    replace    = "redacted_url"
}
```

The JSON stage adds the following key-value pairs into the extracted map:
```
time: 2023-01-01T01:00:00.000000001Z
level: info
msg: "11.11.11.11 - "POST /loki/api/push/ HTTP/1.1" 200 932 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"
```

The `replace` stage acts on the `msg` value. The capture group matches against
`/loki/api/push` and is replaced by `redacted_url`.

The `msg` value is finally transformed into:
```
msg: "11.11.11.11 - "POST redacted_url HTTP/1.1" 200 932 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"
```

The `replace` field can use a set of templating functions, by utilizing Go's
[text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) package.

Let's see how this works with named capture groups with a sample log line
and stage.
```
11.11.11.11 - agent [01/Jan/2023:00:00:01 +0200]

stage.replace {
    expression = "^(?P<ip>\\S+) (?P<identd>\\S+) (?P<user>\\S+) \\[(?P<timestamp>[\\w:/]+\\s[+\\-]\\d{4})\\]"
    replace    = "{{ .Value | ToUpper }}"
}
```

Since `source` is empty, the regex parses the log line itself and extracts the
named capture groups to the shared map of values. The `replace` field acts on
these extracted values and converts them to uppercase:
```
ip: 11.11.11.11
identd: -
user: FRANK
timestamp: 01/JAN/2023:00:00:01 +0200
```

and the log line becomes:
```
11.11.11.11 - FRANK [01/JAN/2023:00:00:01 +0200]
```

The following list contains available functions with examples of
more complex `replace` fields.
```
ToLower, ToUpper, Replace, Trim, TrimLeftTrimRight, TrimPrefix, TrimSuffix, TrimSpace, Hash, Sha2Hash, regexReplaceAll, regexReplaceAllLiteral

"{{ if eq .Value \"200\" }}{{ Replace .Value \"200\" \"HttpStatusOk\" -1 }}{{ else }}{{ .Value | ToUpper }}{{ end }}"
"*IP4*{{ .Value | Hash "salt" }}*"
```

### stage.static_labels block

The `stage.static_labels` inner block configures a static_labels processing stage
that adds a static set of labels to incoming log entries.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name     | Type          | Description                                    | Default | Required |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `values` | `map(string)` | Configures a `static_labels` processing stage. | `{}`    | no       |


```river
stage.static_labels {
    values = {
      foo = "fooval",
      bar = "barval",
    }
}
```

### stage.template block

The `stage.template` inner block configures a transforming stage that allows users to
manipulate the values in the extracted map by using Go's `text/template`
[package](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) syntax. This stage is primarily
useful for manipulating and standardizing data from previous stages before
setting them as labels in a subsequent stage. Example use cases are replacing
spaces with underscores, converting uppercase strings to lowercase, or hashing
a value.

The template stage can also create new keys in the extracted map.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name       | Type     | Description                                                                          | Default | Required |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `source`   | `string` | Name from extracted data to parse. If the key doesn't exist, a new entry is created. |         | yes      |
| `template` | `string` | Go template string to use.                                                           |         | yes      |

The template string can be any valid template that can be used by Go's `text/template`. It supports all functions from the [sprig package](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/), as well as the following list of custom functions:
```
ToLower, ToUpper, Replace, Trim, TrimLeftTrimRight, TrimPrefix, TrimSuffix, TrimSpace, Hash, Sha2Hash, regexReplaceAll, regexReplaceAllLiteral
```

More details on each of these functions can be found in the [supported
functions][] section below.

[supported functions]: #supported-functions

Assuming no data is present on the extracted map, the following stage simply
adds the `new_key: "hello_world"`key-value pair to the shared map.
```river
stage.template {
    source   = "new_key"
    template = "hello_world"
}
```

If the `source` value exists in the extract fields, its value can be referred to as `.Value` in the template.
The next stage takes the current value of `app` from the extracted map,
converts it to lowercase, and adds a suffix to its value:
```river
stage.template {
    source   = "app"
    template = "{{ ToLower .Value }}_some_suffix"
}
```

Any previously extracted keys are available for `template` to expand and use.
The next stage takes the current values for `level`, `app` and `module` and
creates a new key named `output_message`:
```river
stage.template {
    source   = "output_msg"
    template = "{{ .level }} for app {{ ToUpper .app }} in module {{.module}}"
}
```

A special key named `Entry` can be used to reference the current line; this can
be useful when you need to append/prepend something to the log line, like this snippet:
```river
stage.template {
    source   = "message"
    template = "{{.app }}: {{ .Entry }}"
}
stage.output {
    source = "message"
}
```

#### Supported functions
In addition to supporting all functions from the [sprig package](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/), the `template` stage supports the following custom functions.

##### ToLower and ToUpper
`ToLower` and `ToUpper` convert the entire string to lowercase and
uppercase, respectively.

Examples:
```river
stage.template {
    source   = "out"
    template = "{{ ToLower .app }}"
}
stage.template {
    source   = "out"
    template = "{{ .app | ToUpper }}"
}
```

##### Replace
The `Replace` function syntax is defined as `{{ Replace <string> <old> <new> <n> }}`.

The function returns a copy of the input string, with instances of the `<old>`
argument being replaced by `<new>`. The function replaces up to `<n>`
non-overlapping instances of the second argument. If `<n>` is less than zero,
there is no limit on the number of replacement. Finally, if `<old>` is empty,
it matches before and after every UTF-8 character in the string.

This example replaces the first two instances of the `loki` word by `Loki`:
```river
stage.template {
    source   = "output"
    template = "{{ Replace .Value "loki" "Loki" 2 }}"
}
```

##### Trim, TrimLeft, TrimRight, TrimSpace, TrimPrefix, TrimSuffix
* `Trim` returns a slice of the string `s` with all leading and trailing Unicode
  code points contained in `cutset` removed.
* `TrimLeft` and `TrimRight` are the same as Trim except that they
  trim only leading and trailing characters, respectively.
* `TrimSpace` returns a slice of the string s, with all leading and trailing
white space removed, as defined by Unicode.
* `TrimPrefix` and `TrimSuffix` trim the supplied prefix or suffix, respectively.
Examples:
```river
stage.template {
    source   = "output"
    template = "{{ Trim .Value ",. " }}"
}
stage.template {
    source   = "output"
    template = "{{ TrimSpace .Value }}"
}
stage.template {
    source   = "output"
    template = "{{ TrimPrefix .Value "--" }}"
}
```

##### Regex
`regexReplaceAll` returns a copy of the input string, replacing matches of the
Regexp with the replacement string. Inside the replacement string, `$` characters
are interpreted as in Expand functions, so for instance, $1 represents the first captured
submatch.

`regexReplaceAllLiteral` returns a copy of the input string, replacing matches
of the Regexp with the replacement string. The replacement string is
substituted directly, without using Expand.

```river
stage.template {
    source   = "output"
    template = "{{ regexReplaceAll "(a*)bc" .Value "${1}a" }}"
}
stage.template {
    source   = "output"
    template = "{{ regexReplaceAllLiteral "(ts=)" .Value "timestamp=" }}"
}
```

##### Hash and Sha2Hash
`Hash` returns a `Sha3_256` hash of the string, represented as a hexadecimal number of 64 digits. You can use it to obfuscate sensitive data and PII in the logs. It requires a (fixed) salt value, to add complexity to low input domains (e.g., all possible social security numbers).
`Sha2Hash` returns a `Sha2_256` of the string which is faster and less CPU-intensive than `Hash`, however it is less secure.

Examples:
```river
stage.template {
    source   = "output"
    template = "{{ Hash .Value "salt" }}"
}
stage.template {
    source   = "output"
    template = "{{ Sha2Hash .Value "salt" }}"
}
```

We recommend using Hash as it has a stronger hashing algorithm.

### stage.tenant block

The `stage.tenant` inner block sets the tenant ID for the log entry by obtaining it from a
field in the extracted data map, a label, or a provided value.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name     | Type     | Description                                            | Default | Required |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `label`  | `string` | The label to set as tenant ID.                         | `""`    | no       |
| `source` | `string` | The name from the extracted value to use as tenant ID. | `""`    | no       |
| `value`  | `string` | The value to set as the tenant ID.                     | `""`    | no       |

The block expects only one of `label`, `source` or `value` to be provided.

The following stage assigns the fixed value `team-a` as the tenant ID:
```river
stage.tenant {
    value = "team-a"
}
```

This stage extracts the tenant ID from the `customer_id` field after
parsing the log entry as JSON in the shared extracted map:
```river
stage.json {
    expressions = { "customer_id" = "" }
}
stage.tenant {
    source = "customer_id"
}
```

The final example extracts the tenant ID from a label set by a previous stage:
```river
stage.labels {
    "namespace" = "k8s_namespace"
}
stage.tenant {
    label = "namespace"
}
```

### stage.timestamp block

The `stage.timestamp` inner block configures a processing stage that sets the
timestamp of log entries before they're forwarded to the next component. When
no timestamp stage is set, the log entry timestamp defaults to the time when
the log entry was scraped.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name                | Type           | Description                                                 | Default   | Required |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| `source`            | `string`       | Name from extracted values map to use for the timestamp.    |           | yes      |
| `format`            | `string`       | Determines how to parse the source string.                  |           | yes      |
| `fallback_formats`  | `list(string)` | Fallback formats to try if the `format` field fails.        | `[]`      | no       |
| `location`          | `string`       | IANA Timezone Database location to use when parsing.        | `""`      | no       |
| `action_on_failure` | `string`       | What to do when the timestamp can't be extracted or parsed. | `"fudge"` | no       |

The `source` field defines which value from the shared map of extracted values
the stage should attempt to parse as a timestamp.

The `format` field defines _how_ that source should be parsed.

First off, the `format` can be set to one of the following shorthand values for
commonly-used forms:
```
ANSIC: Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 2006
UnixDate: Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 MST 2006
RubyDate: Mon Jan 02 15:04:05 -0700 2006
RFC822: 02 Jan 06 15:04 MST
RFC822Z: 02 Jan 06 15:04 -0700
RFC850: Monday, 02-Jan-06 15:04:05 MST
RFC1123: Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 MST
RFC1123Z: Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 -0700
RFC3339: 2006-01-02T15:04:05-07:00
RFC3339Nano: 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999-07:00
```

Additionally, support for common Unix timestamps is supported with the
following format values:
```
Unix: 1562708916 or with fractions 1562708916.000000123
UnixMs: 1562708916414
UnixUs: 1562708916414123
UnixNs: 1562708916000000123
```

Otherwise, the field accepts a custom format string that defines how an
arbitrary reference point in history should
be interpreted by the stage. The arbitrary reference point is Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006.

The string value of the field is passed directly to the layout parameter in
Go's [`time.Parse`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Parse) function.

If the custom format has no year component, the stage uses the current year,
according to the system's clock.

The following table shows the supported reference values to use when defining a
custom format.

| Timestamp Component | Format value                                                                                                             |

| Hour                | 3 (12-hour), 03 (12-hour zero prefixed), 15 (24-hour)                                                                    |
| Minute              | 4, 04                                                                                                                    |
| Second              | 5, 05                                                                                                                    |
| Fraction of second  | .000 (ms zero prefixed), .000000 (μs), .000000000 (ns), .999 (ms without trailing zeroes), .999999 (μs), .999999999 (ns) |

| Timezone name       | MST                                                                                                                      |
| Timezone offset     | -0700, -070000 (with seconds), -07, 07:00, -07:00:00 (with seconds)                                                      |
| Timezone ISO-8601   | Z0700 (Z for UTC or time offset), Z070000, Z07, Z07:00, Z07:00:00                                                        |

The `fallback_formats` field defines one or more format fields to try and parse
the timestamp with, if parsing with `format` fails.

The `location` field must be a valid IANA Timezone Database location and
determines in which timezone the timestamp value is interpreted to be in.

The `action_on_failure` field defines what should happen when the source field
doesn't exist in the shared extracted map, or if the timestamp parsing fails.

The supported actions are:

* fudge (default): Change the timestamp to the last known timestamp, summing up
  1 nanosecond (to guarantee log entries ordering).
* skip: Do not change the timestamp and keep the time when the log entry was
  scraped.

The following stage fetches the `time` value from the shared values map, parses
it as a RFC3339 format, and sets it as the log entry's timestamp.

```river
stage.timestamp {
    source = "time"
    format = "RFC3339"
}
```

### stage.geoip block

The `stage.geoip` inner block configures a processing stage that reads an IP address and populates the shared map with geoip fields. Maxmind’s GeoIP2 database is used for the lookup.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name             | Type          | Description                                        | Default | Required |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `db`             | `string`      | Path to the Maxmind DB file.                       |         | yes      |
| `source`         | `string`      | IP from extracted data to parse.                   |         | yes      |
| `db_type`        | `string`      | Maxmind DB type. Allowed values are "city", "asn". |         | no       |
| `custom_lookups` | `map(string)` | Key-value pairs of JMESPath expressions.           |         | no       |


#### GeoIP with City database example:

```
{"log":"log message","client_ip":"34.120.177.193"}

loki.process "example" {
	stage.json {
		expressions = {ip = "client_ip"}
	}

	stage.geoip {
		source  = "ip"
		db      = "/path/to/db/GeoLite2-City.mmdb"
		db_type = "city"
	}

	stage.labels {
		values = {
			geoip_city_name          = "",
			geoip_country_name       = "",
			geoip_continent_name     = "",
			geoip_continent_code     = "",
			geoip_location_latitude  = "",
			geoip_location_longitude = "",
			geoip_postal_code        = "",
			geoip_timezone           = "",
			geoip_subdivision_name   = "",
			geoip_subdivision_code   = "",
		}
	}
}
```

The `json` stage extracts the IP address from the `client_ip` key in the log line. 
Then the extracted `ip` value is given as source to geoip stage. The geoip stage performs a lookup on the IP and populates the following fields in the shared map which are added as labels using the `labels` stage.

The extracted data from the IP used in this example:

- geoip_city_name: Kansas City
- geoip_country_name: United States
- geoip_continet_name: North America
- geoip_continent_code: NA
- geoip_location_latitude: 39.1027
- geoip_location_longitude: -94.5778
- geoip_postal_code: 64184
- geoip_timezone: America/Chicago
- geoip_subdivision_name: Missouri
- geoip_subdivision_code: MO

#### GeoIP with ASN (Autonomous System Number) database example

```
loki.process "example" {
	stage.json {
		expressions = {ip = "client_ip"}
	}

	stage.geoip {
		source  = "ip"
		db      = "/path/to/db/GeoIP2-ASN.mmdb"
		db_type = "asn"
	}

	stage.labels {
		values = {
			geoip_autonomous_system_number       = "",
			geoip_autonomous_system_organization = "",
		}
	}
}
```

The `json` stage extracts the IP address from the `client_ip` key in the log line. 
Then the extracted `ip` value is given as source to geoip stage. The geoip stage performs a lookup on the IP and populates the shared map.

The extracted data from the IP used in this example:

- geoip_autonomous_system_number: 396982
- geoip_autonomous_system_organization: GOOGLE-CLOUD-PLATFORM


#### GeoIP with custom fields example

If the MMDB file used is enriched with custom data, for example, private IP addresses as explained in [the Maxmind blog post](https://github.com/maxmind/mmdb-from-go-blogpost), then it can be extracted from the record using the `custom_lookups` attribute.

```
loki.process "example" {
	stage.json {
		expressions = {ip = "client_ip"}
	}

	stage.geoip {
		source         = "ip"
		db             = "/path/to/db/GeoIP2-Enriched.mmdb"
		db_type        = "city"
		custom_lookups = {
			"department"  = "MyCompany.DeptName",
			"parent_vnet" = "MyCompany.ParentVNet",
			"subnet"      = "MyCompany.Subnet",
		}
	}

	stage.labels {
		values = {
			department  = "",
			parent_vnet = "",
			subnet      = "",
		}
	}
}
```
The `json` stage extracts the IP address from the `client_ip` key in the log line. 
Then the extracted `ip` value is given as source to geoip stage. The geoip stage performs a lookup on the IP and populates the shared map with the data from the city database results in addition to the custom lookups. Lastly, the custom lookup fields from the shared map are added as labels.

## Exported fields

The following fields are exported and can be referenced by other components:

| Name       | Type           | Description                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `receiver` | `LogsReceiver` | A value that other components can use to send log entries to. |

## Component health

`loki.process` is only reported as unhealthy if given an invalid configuration.

## Debug information

`loki.process` does not expose any component-specific debug information.

## Debug metrics
* `loki_process_dropped_lines_total` (counter): Number of lines dropped as part of a processing stage.
* `loki_process_dropped_lines_by_label_total` (counter):  Number of lines dropped when `by_label_name` is non-empty in [stage.limit][]. 

## Example

This example creates a `loki.process` component that extracts the `environment`
value from a JSON log line and sets it as a label named 'env'.

```river
loki.process "local" {
  forward_to = [loki.write.onprem.receiver]

  stage.json {
      expressions = { "extracted_env" = "environment" }
  }

  stage.labels {
      values = { "env" = "extracted_env" }
  }
}
```
