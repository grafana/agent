# otelcol.receiver.jaeger

`otelcol.receiver.jaeger` accepts Jaeger-formatted data over the network and
forwards it to other `otelcol.*` components.

> **NOTE**: `otelcol.receiver.jaeger` is a wrapper over the upstream
> OpenTelemetry Collector `jaeger` receiver. Bug reports or feature requests
> will be redirected to the upstream repository, if necessary.

Multiple `otelcol.receiver.jaeger` components can be specified by giving them
different labels.

## Usage

```river
otelcol.receiver.jaeger "LABEL" {
  protocols {
    grpc {}
    thrift_http {}
    thrift_binary {}
    thrift_compact {}
  }

  output {
    metrics = [...]
    logs    = [...]
    traces  = [...]
  }
}
```

## Arguments

`otelcol.receiver.jaeger` doesn't support any arguments and is configured fully
through inner blocks.

## Blocks

The following blocks are supported inside the definition of
`otelcol.receiver.jaeger`:

Hierarchy | Block | Description | Required
--------- | ----- | ----------- | --------
protocols | [protocols][] | Configures the protocols the component can accept traffic over. | yes
protocols > grpc | [grpc][] | Configures a Jaeger gRPC server to receive traces. | no
protocols > grpc > tls | [tls][] | Configures TLS for the gRPC server. | no
protocols > grpc > keepalive | [keepalive][] | Configures keepalive settings for the configured server. | no
protocols > grpc > keepalive > server_parameters | [server_parameters][] | Server parameters used to configure keepalive settings. | no
protocols > grpc > keepalive > enforcement_policy | [enforcement_policy][] | Enforcement policy for keepalive settings. | no
protocols > thrift_http | [thrift_http][] | Configures a Thrift HTTP server to receive traces. | no
protocols > thrift_http > tls | [tls][] | Configures TLS for the Thrift HTTP server. | no
protocols > thrift_http > cors | [cors][] | Configures CORS for the Thrift HTTP server. | no
protocols > thrift_binary | [thrift_binary][] | Configures a Thrift binary UDP server to receive traces. | no
protocols > thrift_compact | [thrift_compact][] | Configures a Thrift compact UDP server to receive traces. | no
debug_metrics | [debug_metrics][] | Configures the metrics that this component generates to monitor its state. | no
output | [output][] | Configures where to send received telemetry data. | yes

The `>` symbol indicates deeper levels of nesting. For example, `protocols >
grpc` refers to a `grpc` block defined inside a `protocols` block.

[protocols]: #protocols-block
[grpc]: #grpc-block
[tls]: #tls-block
[keepalive]: #keepalive-block
[server_parameters]: #server_parameters-block
[enforcement_policy]: #enforcement_policy-block
[thrift_http]: #thrift_http-block
[cors]: #cors-block
[thrift_binary]: #thrift_binary-block
[thrift_compact]: #thrift_compact-block
[debug_metrics]: #debug_metrics-block
[output]: #output-block

### protocols block

The `protocols` block defines a set of protocols that will be used to accept
traces over the network.

`protocols` doesn't support any arguments and is configured fully through inner
blocks.

`otelcol.receiver.jeager` requires at least one protocol block (`grpc`,
`thrift_http`, `thrift_binary`, or `thrift_compact`) to be provided.

### grpc block

The `grpc` block configures a gRPC server which can accept Jaeger traces. If
the `grpc` block isn't provided, a gRPC server isn't started.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`endpoint` | `string` | `host:port` to listen for traffic on. | `"0.0.0.0:14250"` | no
`transport` | `string` | Transport to use for the gRPC server. | `"tcp"` | no
`max_recv_msg_size` | `string` | Maximum size of messages the server will accept. 0 disables a limit. | | no
`max_concurrent_streams` | `number` | Limit the number of concurrent streaming RPC calls. | | no
`read_buffer_size` | `string` | Size of the read buffer the gRPC server will use for reading from clients. | `"512KiB"` | no
`write_buffer_size` | `string` | Size of the write buffer the gRPC server will use for writing to clients. | | no
`include_metadata` | `boolean` | Propagate incoming connection metadata to downstream consumers. | | no

### tls block

The `tls` block configures TLS settings used for a server. If the `tls` block
isn't provided, TLS won't be used for connections to the server.

### keepalive block

The `keepalive` block configures keepalive settings for connections to a gRPC
server.

`keepalive` doesn't support any arguments and is configured fully through inner
blocks.

### server_parameters block

The `server_parameters` block controls keepalive and maximum age settings for gRPC
servers.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`max_connection_idle` | `duration` | Maximum age for idle connections. | `"infinity"` | no
`max_connection_age` | `duration` | Maximum age for non-idle connections. | `"infinity"` | no
`max_connection_age_grace` | `duration` | Time to wait before forcibly closing connections. | `"infinity"` | no
`time` | `duration` | How often to ping inactive clients to check for liveness. | `"2h"` | no
`timeout` | `duration` | Time to wait before closing inactive clients that do not respond to liveness checks. | `"20s"` | no

### enforcement_policy block

The `enforcement_policy` block configures the keepalive enforcement policy for
gRPC servers. The server will close connections from clients that violate the
configured policy.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`min_time` | `duration` | Minimum time clients should wait before sending a keepalive ping. | `"5m"` | no
`permit_without_stream` | `boolean` | Allow clients to send keepalive pings when there are no active streams. | `false` | no

### thrift_http block

The `thrift_http` block configures an HTTP server which can accept
Thrift-formatted traces. If the `thrift_http` block isn't specified, an HTTP
server isn't started.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`endpoint` | `string` | `host:port` to listen for traffic on. | `"0.0.0.0:14268"` | no
`max_request_body_size` | `string` | Maximum request body size the server will allow. No limit when unset. | | no
`include_metadata` | `boolean` | Propagate incoming connection metadata to downstream consumers. | | no

### cors block

The `cors` block configures CORS settings for an HTTP server.

The `allowed_headers` specifies which headers are acceptable from a CORS
request. The following headers are always implicitly allowed:

* `Accept`

* `Content-Type`
* `Content-Language`

If `allowed_headers` includes `"*"`, all headers will be permitted.

### thrift_binary block

The `thrift_binary` block configures a UDP server which can accept traces
formatted to the Thrift binary protocol. If the `thrift_binary` block isn't
provided, a UDP server isn't started.

The following arguments are supported:
