# otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling

{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/stability/experimental.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT VERSION>" >}}

`otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling` serves a specified Jaeger remote sampling
document.

> **NOTE**: `otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling` is a wrapper over the upstream OpenTelemetry
> Collector `jaegerremotesampling` extension. Bug reports or feature requests will be
> redirected to the upstream repository, if necessary.

Multiple `otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling` components can be specified by giving them
different labels.

## Usage

```river
otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling "LABEL" {
  source {
  }
}
```

## Arguments

`otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling` doesn't support any arguments and is configured fully
through inner blocks.

## Blocks

The following blocks are supported inside the definition of
`otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling`:

Hierarchy | Block | Description | Required
--------- | ----- | ----------- | --------
http | [http][] | Configures the http server to serve Jaeger remote sampling. | no
http > tls | [tls][] | Configures TLS for the HTTP server. | no
http > cors | [cors][] | Configures CORS for the HTTP server. | no
grpc | [grpc][] | Configures the grpc server to serve Jaeger remote sampling. | no
grpc > tls | [tls][] | Configures TLS for the gRPC server. | no
grpc > keepalive | [keepalive][] | Configures keepalive settings for the configured server. | no
grpc > keepalive > server_parameters | [server_parameters][] | Server parameters used to configure keepalive settings. | no
grpc > keepalive > enforcement_policy | [enforcement_policy][] | Enforcement policy for keepalive settings. | no
source | [source][] | Configures the Jaeger remote sampling document. | yes

The `>` symbol indicates deeper levels of nesting. For example, `grpc > tls`
refers to a `tls` block defined inside a `grpc` block.

[cors]: #cors-block
[grpc]: #grpc-block
[keepalive]: #keepalive-block
[server_parameters]: #server_parameters-block

An HTTP proxy can be configured through the following environment variables:

* `HTTPS_PROXY`
* `NO_PROXY`

The `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable specifies a URL to use for proxying
requests. Connections to the proxy are established via [the `HTTP CONNECT`
method][HTTP CONNECT].

The `NO_PROXY` environment variable is an optional list of comma-separated
hostnames for which the HTTPS proxy should _not_ be used. Each hostname can be
provided as an IP address (`1.2.3.4`), an IP address in CIDR notation
(`1.2.3.4/8`), a domain name (`example.com`), or `*`. A domain name matches
that domain and all subdomains. A domain name with a leading "."
(`.example.com`) matches subdomains only. `NO_PROXY` is only read when
`HTTPS_PROXY` is set.

Because `otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling` uses gRPC, the configured proxy server must be
able to handle and proxy HTTP/2 traffic.

### tls client block

The `tls` block configures TLS settings used for the connection to the gRPC
server.

{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/reference/components/otelcol-tls-config-block.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT VERSION>" >}}

### keepalive client block

The `keepalive` block configures keepalive settings for gRPC client
connections.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`ping_wait` | `duration` | How often to ping the server after no activity. | | no
`ping_response_timeout` | `duration` | Time to wait before closing inactive connections if the server does not respond to a ping. | | no
`ping_without_stream` | `boolean` | Send pings even if there is no active stream request. | | no

## Component health

`otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling` is only reported as unhealthy if given an invalid
configuration.

## Debug information

`otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling` does not expose any component-specific debug information.

## Examples

### Serving from a file

This example configures the Jaeger remote sampling extension to load a local json document and
serve it over the default http port of 5778. Currently this config style exists for consistency
with upstream Opentelemetry Collector components and may be removed.

```river
otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling "example" {
  http {
  }
  source {
    file             = "/path/to/jaeger-sampling.json"
    reload_interval  = "10s"
  }
}
```

### Serving from another component


This example uses the output of a component to determine what sampling
rules to serve: 

```river
local.file "sampling" {
  filename  = "/path/to/jaeger-sampling.json"
}

otelcol.extension.jaeger_remote_sampling "example" {
  http {
  }
  source {
    content = local.file.sampling.content
  }
}
```
