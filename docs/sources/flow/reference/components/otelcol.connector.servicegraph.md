# otelcol.connector.servicegraph

{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/stability/experimental.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT_VERSION>" >}}

`otelcol.connector.servicegraph` accepts span data from other `otelcol` components and 
outputs metrics representing the relationship between various services in a system.
A metric represents an edge in the service graph.
Those metrics can then be used by a data visualization application (e.g. 
[Grafana](/docs/grafana/latest/explore/trace-integration/#service-graph))
to draw the service graph.

> **NOTE**: `otelcol.connector.servicegraph` is a wrapper over the upstream
> OpenTelemetry Collector `servicegraph` connector. Bug reports or feature requests
> will be redirected to the upstream repository, if necessary.

Multiple `otelcol.connector.servicegraph` components can be specified by giving them
different labels.

This component is based on [Grafana Tempo's service graph processor](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/tree/main/modules/generator/processor/servicegraphs).

Service graphs are useful for a number of use-cases:

* Infer the topology of a distributed system. As distributed systems grow, they become more complex. 
  Service graphs can help you understand the structure of the system.
* Provide a high level overview of the health of your system.
  Service graphs show error rates, latencies, and other relevant data.
* Provide a historic view of a system’s topology.
  Distributed systems change very frequently,
  and service graphs offer a way of seeing how these systems have evolved over time.

Since `otelcol.connector.servicegraph` has to process both sides of an edge,
it needs to process all spans of a trace to function properly.
If spans of a trace are spread out over multiple Agent instances, spans cannot be paired reliably.
A solution to this problem is using [otelcol.exporter.loadbalancing]({{< relref "./otelcol.exporter.loadbalancing.md" >}})
in front of Agent instances running `otelcol.connector.servicegraph`.

## Usage

```river
otelcol.connector.servicegraph "LABEL" {
  output {
    metrics = [...]
  }
}
```

## Arguments

`otelcol.connector.servicegraph` supports the following arguments:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`latency_histogram_buckets` | `list(duration)` | Buckets for latency histogram metrics. | `["2ms", "4ms", "6ms", "8ms", "10ms", "50ms", "100ms", "200ms", "400ms", "800ms", "1s", "1400ms", "2s", "5s", "10s", "15s"]` | no
`dimensions` | `list(string)` | A list of dimensions to add with the default dimensions. | `[]` | no
`cache_loop` | `duration` | Configures how often to delete series which have not been updated. | `"1m"` | no
`store_expiration_loop` | `duration` | The time to expire old entries from the store periodically. | `"2s"` | no

Service graphs work by inspecting traces and looking for spans with 
parent-children relationship that represent a request.
`otelcol.connector.servicegraph` uses OpenTelemetry semantic conventions 
to detect a myriad of requests.
The following requests are currently supported:

* A direct request between two services, where the outgoing and the incoming span
  must have a [Span Kind][] value of `client` and `server` respectively.
* A request across a messaging system, where the outgoing and the incoming span 
  must have a [Span Kind][] value of `producer` and `consumer` respectively.
* A database request, where spans have a [Span Kind][] with a value of `client`,
  as well as an attribute with a key of `db.name`.

Every span which can be paired up to form a request is kept in an in-memory store:
* If the TTL of the span expires before it can be paired, it is deleted from the store. 
  TTL is configured in the [store][] block.
* If the span is paired prior to its expiration, a metric is recorded and the span is deleted from the store.

The following metrics are emitted by the processor:

| Metric                                      | Type      | Labels                          | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| traces_service_graph_request_total          | Counter   | client, server, connection_type | Total count of requests between two nodes                    |
| traces_service_graph_request_failed_total   | Counter   | client, server, connection_type | Total count of failed requests between two nodes             |
| traces_service_graph_request_server_seconds | Histogram | client, server, connection_type | Time for a request between two nodes as seen from the server |
| traces_service_graph_request_client_seconds | Histogram | client, server, connection_type | Time for a request between two nodes as seen from the client |
| traces_service_graph_unpaired_spans_total   | Counter   | client, server, connection_type | Total count of unpaired spans                                |
| traces_service_graph_dropped_spans_total    | Counter   | client, server, connection_type | Total count of dropped spans                                 |

Duration is measured both from the client and the server sides.

The `latency_histogram_buckets` argument controls the buckets for 
`traces_service_graph_request_server_seconds` and `traces_service_graph_request_client_seconds`.

Each emitted metrics series have a `client` and a `server` label corresponding with the 
service doing the request and the service receiving the request. The value of the label 
is derived from the `service.name` resource attribute of the two spans.

The `connection_type` label may not be set. If it is set, its value will be either `messaging_system` or `database`.

Additional labels can be included using the `dimensions` configuration option:
* Those labels will have a prefix to mark where they originate (client or server span kinds).
  The `client_` prefix relates to the dimensions coming from spans with a [Span Kind][] of `client`.
  The `server_` prefix relates to the dimensions coming from spans with a [Span Kind][] of `server`.
* Firstly the resource attributes will be searched. If the attribute is not found, 
  the span attributes will be searched.

## Blocks

The following blocks are supported inside the definition of
`otelcol.connector.servicegraph`:

Hierarchy | Block | Description | Required
--------- | ----- | ----------- | --------
store | [store][] | Configures the in-memory store for spans. | no
output | [output][] | Configures where to send telemetry data. | yes

[store]: #store-block
[output]: #output-block

### store block

The `store` block configures the in-memory store for spans.

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`max_items` | `number` | Maximum number of items to keep in the store. | `1000` | no

## Exported fields

The following fields are exported and can be referenced by other components:

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
`input` | `otelcol.Consumer` | A value that other components can use to send telemetry data to.

`input` accepts `otelcol.Consumer` traces telemetry data. It does not accept metrics and logs.

## Component health

`otelcol.connector.servicegraph` is only reported as unhealthy if given an invalid
configuration.

## Debug information

`otelcol.connector.servicegraph` does not expose any component-specific debug
information.

## Example

The example below accepts traces, creates service graph metrics from them, and writes the metrics to Mimir.
The traces are written to Tempo.

`otelcol.connector.servicegraph` also adds a label to each metric with the value of the "http.method"
span/resource attribute.

```river
otelcol.receiver.otlp "default" {
  grpc {
    endpoint = "0.0.0.0:4320"
  }
  
  output {
    traces  = [otelcol.connector.servicegraph.default.input,otelcol.exporter.otlp.grafana_cloud_tempo.input]
  }
}

otelcol.connector.servicegraph "default" {
  dimensions = ["http.method"]
  output {
    metrics = [otelcol.exporter.prometheus.default.input]
  }
}

otelcol.exporter.prometheus "default" {
  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.mimir.receiver]
}

prometheus.remote_write "mimir" {
  endpoint {
    url = "https://prometheus-xxx.grafana.net/api/prom/push"
    
    basic_auth {
      username = env("PROMETHEUS_USERNAME")
      password = env("GRAFANA_CLOUD_API_KEY")
    }
  }
}

otelcol.exporter.otlp "grafana_cloud_tempo" {
  client {
    endpoint = "https://tempo-xxx.grafana.net/tempo"
    auth     = otelcol.auth.basic.grafana_cloud_tempo.handler
  }
}

otelcol.auth.basic "grafana_cloud_tempo" {
  username = env("TEMPO_USERNAME")
  password = env("GRAFANA_CLOUD_API_KEY")
}
```

Some of the metrics in Mimir may look like this:
```
traces_service_graph_request_total{client="shop-backend",failed="false",server="article-service",client_http_method="DELETE",server_http_method="DELETE"}
traces_service_graph_request_failed_total{client="shop-backend",client_http_method="POST",failed="false",server="auth-service",server_http_method="POST"}
