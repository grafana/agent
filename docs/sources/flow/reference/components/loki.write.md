# loki.write

`loki.write` receives log entries from other loki components and sends them
over the network using Loki's `logproto` format.

Multiple `loki.write` components can be specified by giving them
different labels.

## Usage

```river
loki.write "LABEL" {
  endpoint {
    url = REMOTE_WRITE_URL
  }
}
```

## Arguments

`loki.write` supports the following arguments:

Name              | Type          | Description                                      | Default | Required
----------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------- | --------
`max_streams`     | `int`         | Maximum number of active streams. | 0 (no limit)  | no
`external_labels` | `map(string)` | Labels to add to logs sent over the network.     |         | no

## Blocks

The following blocks are supported inside the definition of
`loki.write`:

Hierarchy | Block | Description | Required
--------- | ----- | ----------- | --------
endpoint | [endpoint][] | Location to send logs to. | no
wal | [wal][] | Write-ahead log configuration. | no
endpoint > basic_auth | [basic_auth][] | Configure basic_auth for authenticating to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > authorization | [authorization][] | Configure generic authorization to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > oauth2 | [oauth2][] | Configure OAuth2 for authenticating to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > oauth2 > tls_config | [tls_config][] | Configure TLS settings for connecting to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > tls_config | [tls_config][] | Configure TLS settings for connecting to the endpoint. | no
| endpoint > queue_config        | [queue_config][]  | When WAL is enabled, configures the queue client.        | no       |

The `>` symbol indicates deeper levels of nesting. For example, `endpoint >
basic_auth` refers to a `basic_auth` block defined inside an
`endpoint` block.

[endpoint]: #endpoint-block
[wal]: #wal-block
[basic_auth]: #basic_auth-block
[authorization]: #authorization-block
[oauth2]: #oauth2-block
[tls_config]: #tls_config-block
[queue_config]: #queue_config-block

### endpoint block

The `endpoint` block describes a single location to send logs to. Multiple
`endpoint` blocks can be provided to send logs to multiple locations.

The following arguments are supported:

Name                     | Type                | Description                                                   | Default   | Required

 At most, one of the following can be provided:
 - [`bearer_token` argument](#endpoint-block).
 - [`bearer_token_file` argument](#endpoint-block).
 - [`basic_auth` block][basic_auth].
 - [`authorization` block][authorization].
 - [`oauth2` block][oauth2].

{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/reference/components/http-client-proxy-config-description.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT_VERSION>" >}}

If no `tenant_id` is provided, the component assumes that the Loki instance at
`endpoint` is running in single-tenant mode and no X-Scope-OrgID header is
sent.

When multiple `endpoint` blocks are provided, the `loki.write` component
creates a client for each. Received log entries are fanned-out to these clients
in succession. That means that if one client is bottlenecked, it may impact
the rest.

Endpoints can be named for easier identification in debug metrics by using the
`name` argument. If the `name` argument isn't provided, a name is generated
based on a hash of the endpoint settings.

The `retry_on_http_429` argument specifies whether `HTTP 429` status code
responses should be treated as recoverable errors; other `HTTP 4xx` status code
responses are never considered recoverable errors. When `retry_on_http_429` is
enabled, the retry mechanism will be governed by the backoff configuration specified through `min_backoff_period`, `max_backoff_period ` and `max_backoff_retries` attributes.

### queue_config block (experimental)

The optional `queue_config` block configures, when WAL is enabled (see [Write-Ahead block](#wal-block-experimental)), how the
underlying client queues batches of logs to be sent to Loki.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name            | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                      | Default | Required |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `capacity`      | `string`   | Controls the size of the underlying send queue buffer. This setting should be considered a worst-case scenario of memory consumption, in which all enqueued batches are full. | `10MiB`  | no       |
| `drain_timeout` | `duration` | Configures the maximum time the client can take to drain the send queue upon shutdown. During that time, it will enqueue pending batches and drain the send queue sending each. | `"1m"`  | no       |

### wal block (experimental)

The optional `wal` block configures the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) used in the Loki remote-write client. To enable the WAL,
you must include the `wal` block in your configuration. When the WAL is enabled, the log entries sent to the `loki.write`
component are first written to a WAL under the `dir` directory and then read into the remote-write client. This process
provides durability guarantees when an entry reaches this component. The client knows when to read from the WAL using the
following two mechanisms:
- The WAL-writer side of the `loki.write` component notifies the reader side that new data is available.
- The WAL-reader side periodically checks if there is new data, increasing the wait time exponentially between
`min_read_frequency` and `max_read_frequency`.

The WAL is located inside a component-specific directory relative to the
storage path {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is configured to use. See the
[`agent run` documentation][run] for how to change the storage path.

The following arguments are supported:

Name                  | Type       | Description                                                                                                        | Default   | Required
--------------------- |------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------| --------
`enabled`                 | `bool`     | Whether to enable the WAL.                                                                                         | false     | no
`max_segment_age`             | `duration` | Maximum time a WAL segment should be allowed to live. Segments older than this setting will be eventually deleted. | `"1h"`    | no
`min_read_frequency`          | `duration` | Minimum backoff time in the backup read mechanism.                                                                 | `"250ms"` | no
`max_read_frequency`          | `duration` | Maximum backoff time in the backup read mechanism.                                                                 | `"1s"`    | no
`drain_timeout`          | `duration` | Maximum time the WAL drain procedure can take, before being forcefully stopped.                                    | `"30s"`   | no

* `loki_write_stream_lag_seconds` (gauge): Difference between current time and last batch timestamp for successful sends.

## Examples

The following examples show you how to create `loki.write` components that send log entries to different destinations.

### Send log entries to a local Loki instance

You can create a `loki.write` component that sends your log entries to a local Loki instance:

```river
loki.write "local" {
    endpoint {
        url = "http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push"
    }
}
```

### Send log entries to a managed service

You can create a `loki.write` component that sends your log entries to a managed service, for example, Grafana Cloud. The Loki username and Grafana Cloud API Key are injected in this example through environment variables.

```river
loki.write "default" {
    endpoint {
        url = "https://logs-xxx.grafana.net/loki/api/v1/push"
        basic_auth {
            username = env("LOKI_USERNAME")
            password = env("GRAFANA_CLOUD_API_KEY")
        }
    }
}
```
## Technical details

`loki.write` uses [snappy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(compression)) for compression.

Any labels that start with `__` will be removed before sending to the endpoint.
