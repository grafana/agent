# prometheus.scrape

`prometheus.scrape` configures a Prometheus scraping job for a given set of
`targets`. The scraped metrics are forwarded to the list of receivers passed in
`forward_to`.

Multiple `prometheus.scrape` components can be specified by giving them
different labels.

## Usage

```
prometheus.scrape "LABEL" {
  targets    = TARGET_LIST
  forward_to = RECEIVER_LIST
}
```

## Arguments

The component configures and starts a new scrape job to scrape all the
input targets. The list of arguments that can be used to configure the block is
presented below.

The scrape job name defaults to the component's unique identifier.

Any omitted fields take on their default values. In case that conflicting
attributes are being passed (e.g. defining both a BearerToken and
BearerTokenFile or configuring both Basic Authorization and OAuth2 at the same
time), the component reports an error.

The following arguments are supported:

 - [`bearer_token` argument](#arguments).
 - [`bearer_token_file` argument](#arguments).
 - [`basic_auth` block][basic_auth].
 - [`authorization` block][authorization].
 - [`oauth2` block][oauth2].

## Blocks

The following blocks are supported inside the definition of `prometheus.scrape`:

Hierarchy | Block | Description | Required
--------- | ----- | ----------- | --------
basic_auth | [basic_auth][] | Configure basic_auth for authenticating to targets. | no
authorization | [authorization][] | Configure generic authorization to targets. | no
oauth2 | [oauth2][] | Configure OAuth2 for authenticating to targets. | no
oauth2 > tls_config | [tls_config][] | Configure TLS settings for connecting to targets via OAuth2. | no
tls_config | [tls_config][] | Configure TLS settings for connecting to targets. | no
clustering | [clustering][] | Configure the component for when the Agent is running in clustered mode. | no

The `>` symbol indicates deeper levels of nesting. For example,
`oauth2 > tls_config` refers to a `tls_config` block defined inside
an `oauth2` block.

[arguments]: #arguments
[basic_auth]: #basic_auth-block
[authorization]: #authorization-block
[oauth2]: #oauth2-block
[tls_config]: #tls_config-block
[clustering]: #clustering-beta

### basic_auth block

{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/reference/components/basic-auth-block.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT_VERSION>" >}}

### authorization block

### tls_config block

{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/reference/components/tls-config-block.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT_VERSION>" >}}

### clustering (beta)

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`enabled` | `bool` | Enables sharing targets with other cluster nodes. | `false` | yes

When {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is [using clustering][], and `enabled` is set to true,
then this `prometheus.scrape` component instance opts-in to participating in
the cluster to distribute scrape load between all cluster nodes.

Clustering assumes that all cluster nodes are running with the same
configuration file, have access to the same service discovery APIs and that all
`prometheus.scrape` components that have opted-in to using clustering, over
the course of a scrape interval, are converging on the same target set from
upstream components in their `targets` argument.

All `prometheus.scrape` components instances opting in to clustering use target
labels and a consistent hashing algorithm to determine ownership for each of
the targets between the cluster peers. Then, each peer only scrapes the subset
of targets that it is responsible for, so that the scrape load is distributed.
When a node joins or leaves the cluster, every peer recalculates ownership and
continues scraping with the new target set. This performs better than hashmod
sharding where _all_ nodes have to be re-distributed, as only 1/N of the
targets ownership is transferred, but is eventually consistent (rather than
fully consistent like hashmod sharding is).

If {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is _not_ running in clustered mode, then the block is a no-op and
`prometheus.scrape` scrapes every target it receives in its arguments.

## Exported fields

`prometheus.scrape` does not export any fields that can be referenced by other
components.

## Component health

`prometheus.scrape` is only reported as unhealthy if given an invalid
configuration.

## Debug information

`prometheus.scrape` reports the status of the last scrape for each configured
scrape job on the component's debug endpoint.

## Debug metrics

* `agent_prometheus_fanout_latency` (histogram): Write latency for sending to direct and indirect components.
* `agent_prometheus_scrape_targets_gauge` (gauge): Number of targets this component is configured to scrape.
* `agent_prometheus_forwarded_samples_total` (counter): Total number of samples sent to downstream components.

## Scraping behavior

The `prometheus.scrape` component borrows the scraping behavior of Prometheus.
Prometheus, and by extent this component, uses a pull model for scraping
metrics from a given set of _targets_.
Each scrape target is defined as a set of key-value pairs called _labels_.
The set of targets can either be _static_, or dynamically provided periodically
by a service discovery component such as `discovery.kubernetes`. The special
label `__address__` _must always_ be present and corresponds to the
`<host>:<port>` that is used for the scrape request.

By default, the scrape job tries to scrape all available targets' `/metrics`
endpoints using HTTP, with a scrape interval of 1 minute and scrape timeout of
10 seconds. The metrics path, protocol scheme, scrape interval and timeout,
query parameters, as well as any other settings can be configured using the
component's arguments.

If a target is hosted at the [in-memory traffic][] address specified by the
[run command][], `prometheus.scrape` will scrape the metrics in-memory,
bypassing the network.

The scrape job expects the metrics exposed by the endpoint to follow the
[OpenMetrics](https://openmetrics.io/) format. All metrics are then propagated
to each receiver listed in the component's `forward_to` argument.

Labels coming from targets, that start with a double underscore `__` are
treated as _internal_, and are removed prior to scraping.

The `prometheus.scrape` component regards a scrape as successful if it
responded with an HTTP `200 OK` status code and returned a body of valid
metrics.

If the scrape request fails, the component's debug UI section contains more
detailed information about the failure, the last successful scrape, as well as
the labels last used for scraping.

The following labels are automatically injected to the scraped time series and
can help pin down a scrape target.

Label                 | Description
--------------------- | ----------
job                   | The configured job name that the target belongs to. Defaults to the fully formed component name.
instance              | The `__address__` or `<host>:<port>` of the scrape target's URL.


Similarly, these metrics that record the behavior of the scrape targets are
also automatically available.
Metric Name                | Description
-------------------------- | -----------
`up`                       | 1 if the instance is healthy and reachable, or 0 if the scrape failed.
`scrape_duration_seconds`  | Duration of the scrape in seconds.
`scrape_samples_scraped`   | The number of samples the target exposed.
`scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling` | The number of samples remaining after metric relabeling was applied.
`scrape_series_added`      | The approximate number of new series in this scrape.
`scrape_timeout_seconds`   | The configured scrape timeout for a target. Useful for measuring how close a target was to timing out using `scrape_duration_seconds / scrape_timeout_seconds`
`scrape_sample_limit`      | The configured sample limit for a target. Useful for measuring how close a target was to reaching the sample limit using `scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling / (scrape_sample_limit > 0)`
`scrape_body_size_bytes`   | The uncompressed size of the most recent scrape response, if successful. Scrapes failing because the `body_size_limit` is exceeded report -1, other scrape failures report 0.

The `up` metric is particularly useful for monitoring and alerting on the
health of a scrape job. It is set to `0` in case anything goes wrong with the
scrape target, either because it is not reachable, because the connection
times out while scraping, or because the samples from the target could not be
processed. When the target is behaving normally, the `up` metric is set to
`1`.

To enable scraping of Prometheus' native histograms over gRPC, the
`enable_protobuf_negotiation` must be set to true. The
`scrape_classic_histograms` argument controls whether the component should also
scrape the 'classic' histogram equivalent of a native histogram, if it is
present.

## Example

The following example sets up the scrape job with certain attributes (scrape
endpoint, scrape interval, query parameters) and lets it scrape two instances
of the [blackbox exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/).
The exposed metrics are sent over to the provided list of receivers, as
defined by other components.

```river
prometheus.scrape "blackbox_scraper" {
  targets = [
    {"__address__" = "blackbox-exporter:9115", "instance" = "one"},
    {"__address__" = "blackbox-exporter:9116", "instance" = "two"},
  ]

  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.grafanacloud.receiver, prometheus.remote_write.onprem.receiver]

  scrape_interval = "10s"
  params          = { "target" = ["grafana.com"], "module" = ["http_2xx"] }
  metrics_path    = "/probe"
}
```

Here are the endpoints that are being scraped every 10 seconds:
```
http://blackbox-exporter:9115/probe?target=grafana.com&module=http_2xx
http://blackbox-exporter:9116/probe?target=grafana.com&module=http_2xx
```

### Technical details

`prometheus.scrape` supports [gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) compression.

The following special labels can change the behavior of prometheus.scrape:
* `__address__` is the name of the label that holds the `<host>:<port>` address of a scrape target.
* `__metrics_path__`   is the name of the label that holds the path on which to scrape a target.
* `__scheme__` is the name of the label that holds the scheme (http,https) on which to  scrape a target.
* `__scrape_interval__` is the name of the label that holds the scrape interval used to scrape a target.
* `__scrape_timeout__` is the name of the label that holds the scrape timeout used to scrape a target.
* `__param_<name>` is a prefix for labels that provide URL parameters `<name>` used to scrape a target.

Special labels added after a scrape
* `__name__` is the label name indicating the metric name of a timeseries.
* `job` is the label name indicating the job from which a timeseries was scraped.
* `instance` is the label name used for the instance label.
