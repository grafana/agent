# prometheus.remote_write

`prometheus.remote_write` collects metrics sent from other components into a
Write-Ahead Log (WAL) and forwards them over the network to a series of
user-supplied endpoints. Metrics are sent over the network using the
[Prometheus Remote Write protocol][remote_write-spec].

Multiple `prometheus.remote_write` components can be specified by giving them
different labels.

[remote_write-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit

## Usage

```river
prometheus.remote_write "LABEL" {
  endpoint {
    url = REMOTE_WRITE_URL

    ...
  }

  ...
}
```

## Arguments

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`external_labels` | `map(string)` | Labels to add to metrics sent over the network. | | no

## Blocks

The following blocks are supported inside the definition of
`prometheus.remote_write`:

Hierarchy | Block | Description | Required
--------- | ----- | ----------- | --------
endpoint | [endpoint][] | Location to send metrics to. | no
endpoint > http_client_config | [http_client_config][] | HTTP client settings when connecting to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > http_client_config > basic_auth | [basic_auth][] | Configure basic_auth for authenticating to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > http_client_config > authorization | [authorization][] | Configure generic authorization to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > http_client_config > oauth2 | [oauth2][] | Configure OAuth2 for authenticating to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > http_client_config > oauth2 > tls_config | [tls_config][] | Configure TLS settings for connecting to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > http_client_config > tls_config | [tls_config][] | Configure TLS settings for connecting to the endpoint. | no
endpoint > queue_config | [queue_config][] | Configuration for how metrics are batched before sending. | no
endpoint > metadata_config | [metadata_config][] | Configuration for how metric metadata is sent. | no
wal | [wal][] | Configuration for the component's WAL. | no

The `>` symbol indicates deeper levels of nesting. For example, `endpoint >
http_client_config` refers to an `http_client_config` block defined inside an
`endpoint` block.

[endpoint]: #endpoint-block
[http_client_config]: #http_client_config-block
[basic_auth]: #basic_auth-block
[authorization]: #authorization-block
[oauth2]: #oauth2-block
[tls_config]: #tls_config-block
[queue_config]: #queue_config-block
[metadata_config]: #metadata_config-block
[wal]: #wal-block

### endpoint block

The `endpoint` block describes a single location to send metrics to. Multiple
`endpoint` blocks can be provided to send metrics to multiple locations.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`url` | `string` | Full URL to send metrics to. | | **yes**
`name` | `string` | Optional name to identify the endpoint in metrics. | | no
`remote_timeout` | `duration` | Timeout for requests made to the URL. | `"30s"` | no
`headers` | `map(string)` | Extra headers to deliver with the request. | | no
`send_exemplars` | `bool` | Whether exemplars should be sent. | `true` | no

When multiple `endpoint` blocks are provided, metrics are concurrently to all
configured locations. Each endpoint has a _queue_ which is used to read metrics
from the WAL and queue them for sending. The `queue_config` block can be used
to customize the behavior of the queue.

Endpoints can be named for easier identification in debug metrics using the
`name` argument. If the `name` argument isn't provided, a name is generated
based on a hash of the endpoint settings.

### http_client_config block

The `http_client_config` block configures the HTTP client used to connect to an
endpoint.

The following arguments are supported:

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`bearer_token` | `secret` | Bearer token to authenticate with. | | no
`bearer_token_file` | `string` | File containing a bearer token to authenticate with. | | no
`proxy_url` | `string` | HTTP proxy to proxy requests through. | | no
`follow_redirects` | `bool` | Whether redirects returned by the server should be followed. | `true` | no
`enable_http_2` | `bool` | Whether HTTP2 is supported for requests. | `true` | no

`bearer_token`, `bearer_token_file`, `basic_auth`, `authorization`, and
`oauth2` are mutually exclusive and only one can be provided inside of a
`http_client_config` block.

### basic_auth block

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`username` | `string` | Basic auth username. | | no
`password` | `secret` | Basic auth password. | | no
`password_file` | `string` | File containing the basic auth password. | | no

`password` and `password_file` are mututally exclusive and only one can be
provided inside of a `basic_auth` block.

### authorization block

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`type` | `string` | Authorization type, for example, "Bearer". | | no
`credential` | `secret` | Secret value. | | no
`credentials_file` | `string` | File containing the secret value. | | no

`credential` and `credentials_file` are mututally exclusive and only one can be
provided inside of an `authorization` block.

### oauth2 block

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`client_id` | `string` | OAuth2 client ID. | | no
`client_secret` | `secret` | OAuth2 client secret. | | no
`client_secret_file` | `string` | File containing the OAuth2 client secret. | | no
`scopes` | `list(string)` | List of scopes to authenticate with. | | no
`token_url` | `string` | URL to fetch the token from. | | no
`endpoint_params` | `map(string)` | Optional parameters to append to the token URL. | | no
`proxy_url` | `string` | Optional proxy URL for OAuth2 requests. | | no

`client_secret` and `client_secret_file` are mututally exclusive and only one
can be provided inside of an `oauth2` block.

### tls_config block

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`ca_file` | `string` | CA certificate to validate the server with. | | no
`cert_file` | `string` | Certificate file for client authentication. | | no
`key_file` | `string` | Key file for client authentication. | | no
`server_name` | `string` | ServerName extension to indicate the name of the server. | | no
`insecure_skip_verify` | `bool` | Disables validation of the server certificate. | | no
`min_version` | `string` | Minimum acceptable TLS version. | | no

When `min_version` is not provided, the minimum acceptable TLS version is
inherited from Go's default minimum version, TLS 1.2. If `min_version` is
provided, it must be set to one of the following strings:

* `"TLS10"` (TLS 1.0)
* `"TLS11"` (TLS 1.1)
* `"TLS12"` (TLS 1.2)
* `"TLS13"` (TLS 1.3)

### queue_config block

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`capacity` | `number` | Number of samples to buffer per shard. | `2500` | no
`min_shards` | `number` | Minimum amount of concurrent shards sending samples to the endpoint. | `1` | no
`max_shards` | `number` | Maximum number of concurrent shards sending samples to the endpoint. | `200` | no
`max_samples_per_send` | `number` | Maximum number of samples per send. | `500` | no
`batch_send_deadline` | `duration` | Maximum time samples will wait in the buffer before sending. | `"5s"` | no
`min_backoff` | `duration` | Initial retry delay. The backoff time gets doubled for each retry. | `"30ms"` | no
`max_backoff` | `duration` | Maximum retry delay. | `"5s"` | no
`retry_on_http_429` | `bool` | Retry when an HTTP 429 status code is received. | `false` | no

Each queue then manages a number of concurrent _shards_ which is responsible
for sending a fraction of data to their respective endpoints. The number of
shards is automatically raised if samples are not being sent to the endpoint
quickly enough. The range of permitted shards can be configured with the
`min_shards` and `max_shards` arguments.

Each shard has a buffer of samples it will keep in memory, controlled with the
`capacity` argument. New metrics aren't read from the WAL unless there is at
least one shard that is not at maximum capcity.

The buffer of a shard is flushed and sent to the endpoint either after the
shard reaches the number of samples specified by `max_samples_per_send` or the
duration specified by `batch_send_deadline` has elapsed since the last flush
for that shard.

Shards retry requests which fail due to a recoverable error. An error is
recoverable if the server responds with an `HTTP 5xx` status code. The delay
between retries can be customized with the `min_backoff` and `max_backoff`
arguments.

The `retry_on_http_429` argument specifies whether `HTTP 429` status code
responses should be treated as recoverable errors; other `HTTP 4xx` status code
responses are never considered recoverable errors. When `retry_on_http_429` is
enabled, `Retry-After` response headers from the servers are honored.

### metadata_config block

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`send` | `bool` | Controls whether metric metadata is sent to the endpoint. | `true` | no
`send_interval` | `duration` | How frequently metric metadata is sent to the endpoint. | `"1m"` | no
`max_samples_per_send` | `number` | Maximum number of metadata samples to send to the endpoint at once. | `500` | no

### wal block

The `wal` block customizes the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) used to temporarily store
metrics before they are sent to the configured set of endpoints.

Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | --------
`truncate_frequency` | `duration` | How frequently to clean up the WAL. | `"2h"` | no
`min_keepalive_time` | `duration` | Minimum time to keep data in the WAL before it can be removed. | `"5m"` | no
`max_keepalive_time` | `duration` | Maximum time to keep data in the WAL before removing it. | `"8h"` | no

The WAL serves two primary purposes:

* Buffer unsent metrics in case of intermittent network issues.
* Populate in-memory cache after a process restart.

The WAL is located inside a component-specific directory relative to the
storage path Grafana Agent is configured to use. See the
[`agent run` documentation][run] for how to change the storage path.

The `truncate_frequency` argument configures how often to clean up the WAL.
Every time the `truncate_frequency` period elapses, the lower two-thirds of
data is removed from the WAL and is no available for sending.

When a WAL clean-up starts, the lowest successfully sent timestamp is used to
determine how much data is safe to remove from the WAL. The
`min_keepalive_time` and `max_keepalive_time` control the permitted age range
of data in the WAL; samples aren't removed until they are at least as old as
`min_keepalive_time`, and samples are forcibly removed if they are older than
`max_keepalive_time`.
