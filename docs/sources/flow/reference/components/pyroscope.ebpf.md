# pyroscope.ebpf

{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/stability/beta.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT_VERSION>" >}}

`pyroscope.ebpf` configures an ebpf profiling job for the current host. The collected performance profiles are forwarded
to the list of receivers passed in `forward_to`.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
To use the  `pyroscope.ebpf` component you must run {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} as root and inside host pid namespace.
{{< /admonition >}}

You can specify multiple `pyroscope.ebpf` components by giving them different labels, however it is not recommended as
it can lead to additional memory and CPU usage.

## Usage

```river
pyroscope.ebpf "LABEL" {
  targets    = TARGET_LIST
  forward_to = RECEIVER_LIST
}
```

## Arguments

The component configures and starts a new ebpf profiling job to collect performance profiles from the current host.

You can use the following arguments to configure a `pyroscope.ebpf`. Only the
`forward_to` and `targets` fields are required. Omitted fields take their default
values.

## Profile collecting behavior

The `pyroscope.ebpf` component collects stack traces associated with a process running on the current host.
You can use the `sample_rate` argument to define the number of stack traces collected per second. The default is 97.

The following labels are automatically injected into the collected profiles if you have not defined them. These labels
can help you pin down a profiling target.

| Label              | Description                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `service_name`     | Pyroscope service name. It's automatically selected from discovery meta labels if possible. Otherwise defaults to `unspecified`. |
| `__name__`         | pyroscope metric name. Defaults to `process_cpu`.                                                                                |
| `__container_id__` | The container ID derived from target.                                                                                            |

### Targets 

One of the following special labels _must_ be included in each target of `targets` and the label must correspond to the container or process that is profiled:

* `__container_id__`: The container ID.
* `__meta_docker_container_id`: The ID of the Docker container.
* `__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_id`: The ID of the Kubernetes pod container.
* `__process_pid__` : The process ID.

Each process is then associated with a specified target from the targets list, determined by a container ID or process PID. 

If a process's container ID matches a target's container ID label, the stack traces are aggregated per target based on the container ID.
If a process's PID matches a target's process PID label, the stack traces are aggregated per target based on the process PID.
Otherwise the process is not profiled.

### Service name

The special label `service_name` is required and must always be present. If it's not specified, it is
attempted to be inferred from multiple sources:

- `__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_pyroscope_io_service_name` which is a `pyroscope.io/service_name` pod annotation.
- `__meta_kubernetes_namespace` and `__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_name`
- `__meta_docker_container_name`

If `service_name` is not specified and could not be inferred, it is set to `unspecified`.

## Troubleshooting unknown symbols

Symbols are extracted from various sources, including:

- The `.symtab` and `.dynsym` sections in the ELF file.
- The `.symtab` and `.dynsym` sections in the debug ELF file.
- The `.gopclntab` section in Go language ELF files.

The search for debug files follows [gdb algorithm](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Separate-Debug-Files.html).
For example, if the profiler wants to find the debug file
for `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6`
with a `.gnu_debuglink` set to `libc.so.6.debug` and a build ID `0123456789abcdef`. The following paths are examined:

- `/usr/lib/debug/.build-id/01/0123456789abcdef.debug`
- `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6.debug`
- `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/.debug/libc.so.6.debug`
- `/usr/lib/debug/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6.debug`

### Dealing with unknown symbols

Unknown symbols in the profiles you’ve collected indicate that the profiler couldn't access an ELF file ￼associated with
a given address in the trace.

This can occur for several reasons:

- The process has terminated, making the ELF file inaccessible.
- The ELF file is either corrupted or not recognized as an ELF file.
- There is no corresponding ELF file entry in `/proc/pid/maps` for the address in the stack trace.

### Addressing unresolved symbols

If you only see module names (e.g., `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6`) without corresponding function names, this
indicates that the symbols couldn't be mapped to their respective function names.

This can occur for several reasons:

- The binary has been stripped, leaving no .symtab, .dynsym, or .gopclntab sections in the ELF file.
- The debug file is missing or could not be located.

To fix this for your binaries, ensure that they are either not stripped or that you have separate
debug files available. You can achieve this by running:

```bash
objcopy --only-keep-debug elf elf.debug
strip elf -o elf.stripped
objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=elf.debug elf.stripped elf.debuglink
```

For system libraries, ensure that debug symbols are installed. On Ubuntu, for example, you can install debug symbols
for `libc` by executing:

```bash
apt install libc6-dbg
```

### Understanding flat stack traces

If your profiles show many shallow stack traces, typically 1-2 frames deep, your binary might have been compiled without
frame pointers.

To compile your code with frame pointers, include the `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` flag in your compiler options.

### Profiling interpreted languages

Profiling interpreted languages like Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc., is not ideal using this implementation.
The JIT-compiled methods in these languages are typically not in ELF file format, demanding additional steps for
profiling. For instance, using perf-map-agent and enabling frame pointers for Java.

Interpreted methods will display the interpreter function’s name rather than the actual function.

## Example

### Kubernetes discovery

In the following example, performance profiles are collected from pods on the same node, discovered using
`discovery.kubernetes`. Pod selection relies on the `HOSTNAME` environment variable, which is a pod name if {{< param "PRODUCT_ROOT_NAME" >}} is
used as a {{< param "PRODUCT_ROOT_NAME" >}} Helm chart. The `service_name` label is set
to `{__meta_kubernetes_namespace}/{__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_name}` from Kubernetes meta labels.

```river
discovery.kubernetes "all_pods" {
  role = "pod"
  selectors {
    field = "spec.nodeName=" + env("HOSTNAME")
    role = "pod"
  }
}

discovery.relabel "local_pods" {
  targets = discovery.kubernetes.all_pods.targets
  rule {
    action = "drop"
    regex = "Succeeded|Failed"
    source_labels = ["__meta_kubernetes_pod_phase"]
  }
  rule {
    action = "replace"
    regex = "(.*)@(.*)"
    replacement = "ebpf/${1}/${2}"
    separator = "@"
    source_labels = ["__meta_kubernetes_namespace", "__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_name"]
    target_label = "service_name"
  }
  rule {
    action = "labelmap"
    regex = "__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_(.+)"
  }
  rule {
    action = "replace"
    source_labels = ["__meta_kubernetes_namespace"]
    target_label = "namespace"
  }
  rule {
    action = "replace"
    source_labels = ["__meta_kubernetes_pod_name"]
    target_label = "pod"
  }
  rule {
    action = "replace"
    source_labels = ["__meta_kubernetes_node_name"]
    target_label = "node"
  }
  rule {
    action = "replace"
    source_labels = ["__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_name"]
    target_label = "container"
  }
}
pyroscope.ebpf "local_pods" {
  forward_to = [ pyroscope.write.endpoint.receiver ]
  targets = discovery.relabel.local_pods.output
}

pyroscope.write "endpoint" {
  endpoint {
    url = "http://pyroscope:4100"
  }
}
```

### Docker discovery

The following example collects performance profiles from containers discovered by `discovery.docker` and ignores all
other profiles collected from outside any docker container. The `service_name` label is set to the
`__meta_docker_container_name` label.

```river
discovery.docker "linux" {
  host = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
}

discovery.relabel "local_containers" {
  targets = discovery.docker.linux.targets
  rule {
    action = "replace"
    source_labels = ["__meta_docker_container_name"]
    target_label = "service_name"
  }
}

pyroscope.write "staging" {
  endpoint {
    url = "http://pyroscope:4100"
  }
}

pyroscope.ebpf "default" {  
  forward_to   = [ pyroscope.write.staging.receiver ]
  targets      = discovery.relabel.local_containers.output
}
```
