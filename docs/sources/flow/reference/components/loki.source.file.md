# loki.source.file

`loki.source.file` reads log entries from files and forwards them to other
`loki.*` components.

Multiple `loki.source.file` components can be specified by giving them
different labels.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
`loki.source.file` does not handle file discovery. You can use `local.file_match` for file discovery. Refer to the [File Globbing](#file-globbing) example for more information.

## Usage

```river
loki.source.file "LABEL" {
  targets    = TARGET_LIST
  forward_to = RECEIVER_LIST
}
```

## Arguments

The component starts a new reader for each of the given `targets` and fans out
log entries to the list of receivers passed in `forward_to`.

`loki.source.file` supports the following arguments:

| Name            | Type                 | Description                                                                         | Default | Required |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `targets`       | `list(map(string))`  | List of files to read from.                                                         |         | yes      |
| `forward_to`    | `list(LogsReceiver)` | List of receivers to send log entries to.                                           |         | yes      |
| `encoding`      | `string`             | The encoding to convert from when reading files.                                    | `""`    | no       |
| `tail_from_end` | `bool`               | Whether a log file should be tailed from the end if a stored position is not found. | `false` | no       |

The `encoding` argument must be a valid [IANA encoding][] name. If not set, it
defaults to UTF-8.

You can use the `tail_from_end` argument when you want to tail a large file without reading its entire content.
When set to true, only new logs will be read, ignoring the existing ones.

## Blocks

The following blocks are supported inside the definition of `loki.source.file`:

| Hierarchy      | Name               | Description                                                       | Required |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| decompresssion | [decompresssion][] | Configure reading logs from compressed files.                     | no       |
| file_watch     | [file_watch][]     | Configure how often files should be polled from disk for changes. | no       |

[decompresssion]: #decompresssion-block
[file_watch]: #file_watch-block

### decompresssion block

The `decompression` block contains configuration for reading logs from
compressed files. The following arguments are supported:

| Name            | Type       | Description                                                     | Default | Required |
| --------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `enabled`       | `bool`     | Whether decompression is enabled.                               |         | yes      |
| `initial_delay` | `duration` | Time to wait before starting to read from new compressed files. | 0       | no       |
| `format`        | `string`   | Compression format.                                             |         | yes      |

If you compress a file under a folder being scraped, `loki.source.file` might
try to ingest your file before you finish compressing it. To avoid it, pick
an `initial_delay` that is enough to avoid it.

Currently supported compression formats are:

- `gz` - for gzip
- `z` - for zlib
- `bz2` - for bzip2

The component can only support one compression format at a time, in order to
handle multiple formats, you will need to create multiple components.

### file_watch block

The `file_watch` block configures how often log files are polled from disk for changes.
The following arguments are supported:

| Name                 | Type       | Description                          | Default | Required |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `min_poll_frequency` | `duration` | Minimum frequency to poll for files. | 250ms   | no       |
| `max_poll_frequency` | `duration` | Maximum frequency to poll for files. | 250ms   | no       |

If no file changes are detected, the poll frequency doubles until a file change is detected or the poll frequency reaches the `max_poll_frequency`.

If file changes are detected, the poll frequency is reset to `min_poll_frequency`.

## Exported fields

`loki.source.file` does not export any fields.

## Component health

`loki.source.file` is only reported as unhealthy if given an invalid
configuration.

## Debug information

`loki.source.file` exposes some target-level debug information per reader:

- The tailed path.
- Whether the reader is currently running.
- What is the last recorded read offset in the positions file.

## Debug metrics

- `loki_source_file_read_bytes_total` (gauge): Number of bytes read.
- `loki_source_file_file_bytes_total` (gauge): Number of bytes total.
- `loki_source_file_read_lines_total` (counter): Number of lines read.
- `loki_source_file_encoding_failures_total` (counter): Number of encoding failures.
- `loki_source_file_files_active_total` (gauge): Number of active files.

## Component behavior

If the decompression feature is deactivated, the component will continuously monitor and 'tail' the files.
In this mode, upon reaching the end of a file, the component remains active, awaiting and reading new entries in real-time as they are appended.

Each element in the list of `targets` as a set of key-value pairs called
_labels_.
The set of targets can either be _static_, or dynamically provided periodically
by a service discovery component. The special label `__path__` _must always_ be
present and must point to the absolute path of the file to read from.

<!-- TODO(@tpaschalis) refer to local.file_match -->

The `__path__` value is available as the `filename` label to each log entry
the component reads. All other labels starting with a double underscore are
considered _internal_ and are removed from the log entries before they're
passed to other `loki.*` components.

The component uses its data path (a directory named after the domain's
fully qualified name) to store its _positions file_. The positions file is used
to store read offsets, so that in case of a component or Agent restart,
`loki.source.file` can pick up tailing from the same spot.

If a file is removed from the `targets` list, its positions file entry is also
removed. When it's added back on, `loki.source.file` starts reading it from the
beginning.

## Examples

### Static targets

This example collects log entries from the files specified in the targets
argument and forwards them to a `loki.write` component to be written to Loki.

```river
loki.source.file "tmpfiles" {
  targets    = [
    {__path__ = "/tmp/foo.txt", "color" = "pink"},
    {__path__ = "/tmp/bar.txt", "color" = "blue"},
    {__path__ = "/tmp/baz.txt", "color" = "grey"},
  ]
  forward_to = [loki.write.local.receiver]
}

loki.write "local" {
  endpoint {
    url = "loki:3100/api/v1/push"
  }
}
```

### File globbing

This example collects log entries from the files matching `*.log` pattern
using `local.file_match` component. When files appear or disappear, the list of
targets will be updated accordingly.

```river

local.file_match "logs" {
  path_targets = [
    {__path__ = "/tmp/*.log"},
  ]
}

loki.source.file "tmpfiles" {
  targets    = local.file_match.logs.targets
  forward_to = [loki.write.local.receiver]
}

loki.write "local" {
  endpoint {
    url = "loki:3100/api/v1/push"
  }
}
```

### Decompression

This example collects log entries from the compressed files matching `*.gz`
pattern using `local.file_match` component and the decompression configuration
on the `loki.source.file` component.

```river

local.file_match "logs" {
  path_targets = [
    {__path__ = "/tmp/*.gz"},
  ]
}

loki.source.file "tmpfiles" {
  targets    = local.file_match.logs.targets
  forward_to = [loki.write.local.receiver]
  decompression {
    enabled       = true
    initial_delay = "10s"
    format        = "gz"
  }
}

loki.write "local" {
  endpoint {
    url = "loki:3100/api/v1/push"
  }
}
```
