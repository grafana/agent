# beyla.ebpf

{{< docs/shared lookup="flow/stability/beta.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT_VERSION>" >}}

The `beyla.ebpf` component is used as a wrapper for [Grafana Beyla][] which uses [eBPF][] to automatically inspect application executables and the OS networking layer, and capture trace spans related to web transactions and Rate Errors Duration (RED) metrics for Linux HTTP/S and gRPC services.
You can configure the component to collect telemetry data from a specific port or executable path, and other criteria from Kubernetes metadata.
The component exposes metrics that can be collected by a Prometheus scrape component, and traces that can be forwarded to an OTEL exporter component.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
To run this component, {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} requires administrative (`sudo`) privileges, or at least it needs to be granted the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` capability. In Kubernetes environments, app armour must be disabled for the Deployment or DaemonSet running {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}.

## Usage

```river
beyla.ebpf "<LABEL>" {

}
```

## Arguments

`beyla.ebpf` supports the following arguments:

Name | Type | Description                                               | Default | Required
---- | ---- |-----------------------------------------------------------| ------- | --------
`open_port` | `string` | The port of the running service for Beyla automatically instrumented with eBPF. | | no
`excutable_name` | `string` | The name of the executable to match for Beyla automatically instrumented with eBPF. | | no


`open_port` accepts a comma-separated list of ports (for example, `80,443`), and port ranges (for example, `8000-8999`).
If the executable matches only one of the ports in the list, it is considered to match the selection criteria.

`excutable_name` accepts a regular expression to be matched against the full executable command line, including the directory where the executable resides on the file system.

## Blocks

The following blocks are supported inside the definition of `beyla.ebpf`:

Hierarchy | Block | Description | Required
--------- | ----- | ----------- | --------
routes | [routes][] | Configures the routes to match HTTP paths into user-provided HTTP routes. | no
attributes | [attributes][] | Configures the Beyla attributes for the component. | no
attributes > kubernetes | [kubernetes][] | Configures decorating of the metrics and traces with Kubernetes metadata of the instrumented Pods. | no
discovery | [discovery][] | Configures the discovery for instrumentable processes matching a given criteria. | no
discovery > services | [services][] | Configures the discovery for the component. | no
output | [output][] | Configures where to send received telemetry data. | yes

The `>` symbol indicates deeper levels of nesting. For example,
`attributes > kubernetes` refers to a `kubernetes` block defined inside an
`attributes` block.

[routes]: #routes-block
[attributes]: #attributes-block
[kubernetes]: #kubernetes-block
[discovery]: #discovery-block
[services]: #services-block
[output]: #output-block

### attributes block

This block allows you to configure how some attributes for metrics and traces are decorated.

It contains the following blocks:
[kubernetes]: #kubernetes-block

#### kubernetes block

Name | Type | Description                                               | Default | Required
---- | ---- |-----------------------------------------------------------| ------- | --------
`enable` | `string` | Enable the Kubernetes metadata decoration. | `false` | no

If set to `true`, Beyla will decorate the metrics and traces with Kubernetes metadata. The following labels will be added:

- `k8s.namespace.name`
- `k8s.deployment.name`
- `k8s.statefulset.name`
- `k8s.replicaset.name`
- `k8s.daemonset.name`
- `k8s.node.name`
- `k8s.pod.name`
- `k8s.pod.uid`
- `k8s.pod.start_time`

If set to `false`, the Kubernetes metadata decorator will be disabled.

If set to `autodetect`, Beyla will try to automatically detect if it is running inside Kubernetes, and enable the metadata decoration if that is the case.


### routes block

This block is used to configure the routes to match HTTP paths into user-provided HTTP routes.

Name | Type | Description                                               | Default | Required
---- | ---- |-----------------------------------------------------------| ------- | --------
`patterns` | `list(string)` | List of provided URL path patterns to set the `http.route` trace/metric property | | no
`ignore_patterns` | `list(string)` | List of provided URL path patterns to ignore from `http.route` trace/metric property. | | no
`ignore_mode` | `string` | The mode to use when ignoring patterns. | | no
`unmatched` | `string` | Specifies what to do when a trace HTTP path does not match any of the `patterns` entries | | no

`patterns` and `ignored_patterns` are a list of patterns which a URL path with specific tags which allow for grouping path segments (or ignored them).
The matcher tags can be in the `:name` or `{name}` format.
`ignore_mode` properties are:
- `all` discards metrics and traces matching the `ignored_patterns`.
- `traces` discards only the traces that match the `ignored_patterns`. No metric events are ignored.
- `metrics` discards only the metrics that match the `ignored_patterns`. No trace events are ignored.
`unmatched` properties are:
- `unset` leaves the `http.route` property as unset.
- `path` copies the `http.route` field property to the path value.
  - Caution: This option could lead to a cardinality explosion on the ingester side.
- `wildcard` sets the `http.route` field property to a generic asterisk-based `/**` value.
- `heuristic` automatically derives the `http.route` field property from the path value based on the following rules:
  - Any path components that have numbers or characters outside of the ASCII alphabet (or `-` and _), are replaced by an asterisk `*`.
  - Any alphabetical components that donâ€™t look like words are replaced by an asterisk `*`.


### discovery block

This block is used to configure the discovery for instrumentable processes matching a given criteria.

It contains the following blocks:
[services]: #services-block

### services block

In some scenarios, Beyla will instrument a wide variety of services, such as a Kubernetes DaemonSet that instruments all the services in a node.
This block allows you to filter the services to instrument based on their metadata.

Name | Type | Description                                               | Default | Required
---- | ---- |-----------------------------------------------------------| ------- | --------
`name ` | `string` | The name of the service to match. | | no
`namespace` | `string` | The namespace of the service to match. | | no
`open_ports` | `string` | The port of the running service for Beyla automatically instrumented with eBPF. | | no
`path` | `string` | The path of the running service for Beyla automatically instrumented with eBPF. | | no

`name` defines a name for the matching instrumented service. It is used to populate the `service.name` OTEL property and/or the `service_name` Prometheus property in the exported metrics/traces.
`open_port` accepts a comma-separated list of ports (for example, `80,443`), and port ranges (for example, `8000-8999`). If the executable matches only one of the ports in the list, it is considered to match the selection criteria.
`path` accepts a regular expression to be matched against the full executable command line, including the directory where the executable resides on the file system.


### output block

The `output` block configures a set of components to forward the resulting telemetry data to.

The following arguments are supported:

Name      | Type                     | Description                           | Default | Required
----------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------|---------
`traces`  | `list(otelcol.Consumer)` | List of consumers to send traces to.  | `[]`    | no

You must specify the `output` block, but all its arguments are optional.
By default, telemetry data is dropped.
Configure the `traces` argument to send traces data to other components.

## Exported fields

The following fields are exported and can be referenced by other components.

Name      | Type                | Description
----------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------
`targets` | `list(map(string))` | The targets that can be used to collect metrics of instrumented services with eBPF.

For example, the `targets` can either be passed to a `discovery.relabel` component to rewrite the targets' label sets or to a `prometheus.scrape` component that collects the exposed metrics.

The exported targets use the configured [in-memory traffic][] address specified by the [run command][].

[in-memory traffic]: ../../../concepts/component_controller#in-memory-traffic
[run command]: ../../cli/run/

## Component health

`beyla.ebpf` is only reported as unhealthy if given an invalid
configuration.

## Debug information

`beyla.ebpf` does not expose any component-specific debug
information.

## Example

### Metrics

This example uses a [`prometheus.scrape` component][scrape] to collect metrics from `beyla.ebpf` of
the specified port:

```river
beyla.ebpf "default" {
    open_port = <OPEN_PORT>
}

prometheus.scrape "beyla" {
  targets = beyla.ebpf.default.targets
  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.mimir.receiver]
}

prometheus.remote_write "demo" {
  endpoint {
    url = <PROMETHEUS_REMOTE_WRITE_URL>

    basic_auth {
      username = <USERNAME>
      password = <PASSWORD>
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the following:

- _`<OPEN_PORT>`_: The port of the running service for Beyla automatically instrumented with eBPF.
- _`<PROMETHEUS_REMOTE_WRITE_URL>`_: The URL of the Prometheus remote_write-compatible server to send metrics to.
- _`<USERNAME>`_: The username to use for authentication to the remote_write API.
- _`<PASSWORD>`_: The password to use for authentication to the remote_write API.

[scrape]: ../prometheus.scrape/

### Traces

This example gets traces from `beyla.ebpf` and forwards them to `otlp`:

```river
beyla.ebpf "default" {
    open_port = <OPEN_PORT>
    output {
        traces = [otelcol.processor.batch.default.input]
    }
}

otelcol.processor.batch "default" {
    output {
        traces  = [otelcol.exporter.otlp.default.input]
    }
}

otelcol.exporter.otlp "default" {
    client {
        endpoint = env("<OTLP_ENDPOINT>")
    }
}
```

Replace the following:

- _`<OPEN_PORT>`_: The port of the running service for Beyla automatically instrumented with eBPF.
- _`<OTLP_ENDPOINT>`_: The endpoint of the OpenTelemetry Collector to send traces to.
