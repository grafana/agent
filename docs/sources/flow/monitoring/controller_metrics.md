# Controller metrics

The {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} [component controller][] exposes Prometheus metrics which you can use to investigate the controller state.

Metrics for the controller are exposed at the `/metrics` HTTP endpoint of the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} HTTP server, which defaults to listening on `http://localhost:12345`.

> The documentation for the [`grafana-agent run`][grafana-agent run] command describes how to modify the address {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} listens on for HTTP traffic.

The controller exposes the following metrics:

* `agent_component_controller_evaluating` (Gauge): Set to `1` whenever the  component controller is currently evaluating components.
  This value may be misrepresented depending on how fast evaluations complete or how often evaluations occur.
* `agent_component_controller_running_components` (Gauge): The current number of running components by health.
   The health is represented in the `health_type` label.
* `agent_component_evaluation_seconds` (Histogram): The time it takes to evaluate components after one of their dependencies is updated.
* `agent_component_dependencies_wait_seconds` (Histogram): Time spent by components waiting to be evaluated after one of their dependencies is updated.
* `agent_component_evaluation_queue_size` (Gauge): The current number of component evaluations waiting to be performed.
