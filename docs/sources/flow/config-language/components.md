# Components configuration language
Components are the defining feature of Grafana Agent Flow. They are small,
reusable pieces of business logic that perform a single task (like retrieving
secrets or collecting Prometheus metrics) and can be wired together to form
programmable pipelines of telemetry data.

Under the hood, components are orchestrated via the [_component
controller_]({{< relref "../concepts/component_controller.md" >}}), which is
responsible for scheduling them, reporting their health and debug status,
re-evaluating their arguments and providing their exports.

## Configuring components
Components are created by defining a top-level River block. All components
are identified by their name, describing what the component is responsible for,
while some allow or require to provide an extra user-specified _label_.

The [components docs]({{< relref "../reference/components/_index.md" >}}) contain a list
of all available components. Each one has a complete reference page, so getting
a component to work for you should be as easy as reading its documentation and
copy/pasting from an example.

## Arguments and exports
Most user interactions with components will center around two basic concepts;
_arguments_ and _exports_.

* _Arguments_ are settings which modify the behavior of a component. They can
 be any number of attributes or nested unlabeled blocks, some of them being
required and some being optional. Any optional arguments that are not set will
take on their default values.

* _Exports_ are zero or more output values that can be referred to by other
  components, and can be of any River type.

Here's a quick example; the following block defines a `local.file` component
labeled "targets". The `local.file.targets` component will then expose the
file `content` as a string in its exports.

The `filename` attribute is a _required_ argument; the user can also define a
number of _optional_ ones, in this case `detector`, `poll_frequency` and
`is_secret`, which configure how and how often the file should be polled
as well as whether its contents are sensitive or not.

```river
local.file "targets" {
  // Required argument
  filename = "/etc/agent/targets"

  // Optional arguments: Components may have some optional arguments that
  // do not need to be defined.
  //
  // The optional arguments for local.file are is_secret, detector, and
  // poll_frequency.

  // Exports: a single field named `content`
  // It can be referred to as `local.file.targets.content`
}
```

## Referencing components
To wire components together, one can use the exports of one as the arguments
to another by using references. References can only appear in components.

For example, here's a component that scrapes Prometheus metrics. The `targets`
field is populated with two scrape targets; a constant one `localhost:9001` and
an expression that ties the target to the value of
`local.file.targets.content`.

```river
prometheus.scrape "default" {
  targets = [
    { "__address__" = local.file.targets.content }, // tada!
    { "__address__" = "localhost:9001" },
  ]

  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.default.receiver]
  scrape_config {
    job_name = "default"
  }
}
```

Every time the file contents change, the `local.file` will update its exports,
so the new value will be provided to the `prometheus.scrape` targets field.

Each argument and exported field has an underlying [type]({{< relref "./expressions/types_and_values.md" >}}).
River will type-check expressions before assigning a value to an attribute; the
documentation of each component will have more information about the ways that
you can wire components together.

In the previous example, the contents of the `local.file.targets.content`
expression must first be evaluated in a concrete value then type-checked and
substituted into `prometheus.scrape.default` for it to be configured in turn.
