# Files
River files are plaintext files with the `.river` file extension. Each River
file may be referred to as a "configuration file," or a "River configuration."

River files are required to be UTF-8 encoded, and are permitted to contain
Unicode characters. River files can use both Unix-style line endings (LF) and
Windows-style line endings (CRLF), but formatters may replace all line endings
with Unix-style ones.

## Community tooling
There is experimental support for River in
[vim](https://github.com/rfratto/vim-river) and in
[VSCode](https://github.com/rfratto/vscode-river).
