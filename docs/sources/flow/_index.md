# {{% param "PRODUCT_NAME" %}}

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is a _component-based_ revision of {{< param "PRODUCT_ROOT_NAME" >}} with a focus on ease-of-use,
debuggability, and ability to adapt to the needs of power users.

Components allow for reusability, composability, and focus on a single task.

* **Reusability** allows for the output of components to be reused as the input for multiple other components.
* **Composability** allows for components to be chained together to form a pipeline.
* **Single task** means the scope of a component is limited to one narrow task and thus has fewer side effects.

## Features

* Write declarative configurations with a Terraform-inspired configuration
  language.
* Declare components to configure parts of a pipeline.
* Use expressions to bind components together to build a programmable pipeline.
* Includes a UI for debugging the state of a pipeline.

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is a [distribution][] of the OpenTelemetry
Collector.

Each distribution offers a different collection of components and capabilities.
As a distribution, {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} includes dozens of
OpenTelemetry-native [components](ref:components) from the OpenTelemetry project and
introduces new features such as programmable pipelines, clustering support,
and the ability to share pipelines around the world.

In addition to being an OpenTelemetry Collector distribution,
{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} also includes first-class support for the
Prometheus and Loki ecosystems, allowing you to mix-and-match your pipelines.

## Example

```river
// Discover Kubernetes pods to collect metrics from
discovery.kubernetes "pods" {
  role = "pod"
}

// Scrape metrics from Kubernetes pods and send to a prometheus.remote_write
// component.
prometheus.scrape "default" {
  targets    = discovery.kubernetes.pods.targets
  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.default.receiver]
}

// Get an API key from disk.
local.file "apikey" {
  filename  = "/var/data/my-api-key.txt"
  is_secret = true
}

// Collect and send metrics to a Prometheus remote_write endpoint.
prometheus.remote_write "default" {
  endpoint {
    url = "http://localhost:9009/api/prom/push"

    basic_auth {
      username = "MY_USERNAME"
      password = local.file.apikey.content
    }
  }
}
```


## {{% param "PRODUCT_NAME" %}} configuration generator

The {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} [configuration generator](https://grafana.github.io/agent-configurator/) helps you get a head start on creating flow code.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
This feature is experimental, and it doesn't support all River components.
