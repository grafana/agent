# Configure Grafana Agent in flow mode on Kubernetes

To configure Grafana Agent in flow mode on Kubernetes, perform the following steps:

1. Download a local copy of [values.yaml][] for the Helm chart.

1. Make changes to your copy of `values.yaml` to customize settings for the
   Helm chart.

   Refer to the inline documentation in the `values.yaml` for more information about each option.

1. Run the following command in a terminal to upgrade your Grafana Agent
   installation:

   ```shell
   helm upgrade RELEASE_NAME grafana/grafana-agent -f VALUES_PATH
   ```

   1. Replace `RELEASE_NAME` with the name you used for your Grafana Agent
      installation.

   1. Replace `VALUES_PATH` with the path to your copy of `values.yaml` to use.

## Kustomize considerations

If you are using [Kustomize][] to inflate and install the [Helm chart][], be careful
when using a `configMapGenerator` to generate the ConfigMap containing the
configuration. By default, the generator appends a hash to the name and patches
the resource mentioning it, triggering a rolling update.

This behavior is undesirable for Grafana Agent because the startup time can be significant depending on the size of the Write-Ahead Log. 
You can use the [Helm chart][] sidecar container to watch the ConfigMap and trigger a dynamic reload.

The following is an example snippet of a `kustomization` that disables this behavior:

```yaml
configMapGenerator:
  - name: grafana-agent
    files:
      - config.river
    options:
      disableNameSuffixHash: true
```
