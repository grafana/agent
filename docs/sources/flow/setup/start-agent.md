1. To create a new user called `grafana-agent-flow` run the following command in a terminal window:

   ```shell
   sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false grafana-agent-flow
   ```

1. Create a service file in `/etc/systemd/system` called `grafana-agent-flow.service` with the following contents:

   ```systemd
   [Unit]
   Description=Vendor-neutral programmable observability pipelines.
   Documentation=https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/
   Wants=network-online.target
   After=network-online.target

   [Service]
   Restart=always
   User=grafana-agent-flow
   Environment=HOSTNAME=%H
   EnvironmentFile=/etc/default/grafana-agent-flow
   WorkingDirectory=WORKING_DIRECTORY
   ExecStart=BINARY_PATH run $CUSTOM_ARGS --storage.path=WORKING_PATH $CONFIG_FILE
   ExecReload=/usr/bin/env kill -HUP $MAINPID
   TimeoutStopSec=20s
   SendSIGKILL=no

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   Replace the following:

   * `BINARY_PATH`: The path to the Grafana Agent binary file.
   * `WORKING_DIRECTORY`: The path to a working directory, for example `/var/lib/grafana-agent-flow`.

   # The configuration file holding the agent config.
   CONFIG_FILE="CONFIG_PATH"

   # User-defined arguments to pass to the run command.
   CUSTOM_ARGS=""

   # Restart on system upgrade. Defaults to true.
   RESTART_ON_UPGRADE=true
   ```

   Replace the following:

      * `CONFIG_PATH`: The path to the Grafana Agent configuration file.

1. To reload the service files, run the following command in a terminal window:
