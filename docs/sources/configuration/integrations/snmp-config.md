# snmp config

The `snmp` block configures the `snmp` integration,
which is an embedded version of
[`snmp_exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter). This allows collection of SNMP metrics from the network devices with ease.


## Quick configuration example

To get started, define SNMP targets in Grafana agent's integration block:

```yaml
metrics:
  wal_directory: /tmp/wal
integrations:
  snmp:
    enabled: true
    snmp_targets:
      - name: network_switch_1
        address: 192.168.1.2
        module: if_mib
        walk_params: public
      - name: network_router_2
        address: 192.168.1.3
        module: mikrotik
        walk_params: private
    walk_params:
      private:
        version: 2
        auth:
          community: mysecret
      public:
        version: 2
        auth:
          community: public
```

## Prometheus service discovery use case

If you need to scrape SNMP devices in more dynamic environment, and cannot define devices in `snmp_targets` because targets would change over time, you can use service discovery approach. For instance, with [DNS discovery](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#dns_sd_config):

```yaml

metrics:
  wal_directory: /tmp/wal
  configs:
    - name: snmp_targets
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'snmp'
          dns_sd_configs:
            - names:
              - switches.srv.example.org
              - routers.srv.example.org
          params:
            module: [if_mib]
            walk_params: [private]
          metrics_path: /integrations/snmp/metrics
          relabel_configs:
            - source_labels: [__address__]
              target_label: __param_target
            - source_labels: [__param_target]
              target_label: instance
            - replacement: 127.0.0.1:12345 # address must match grafana agent -server.http.address flag
              target_label: __address__
integrations:
  snmp:
    enabled: true
    scrape_integration: false # set autoscrape to off
    walk_params:
      private:
        version: 2
        auth:
          community: secretpassword
```


Full reference of options:

```yaml
  # Enables the snmp integration, allowing the Agent to automatically
  # collect metrics for the specified github objects.
  [enabled: <boolean> | default = false]

  # Sets an explicit value for the instance label when the integration is
  # self-scraped. Overrides inferred values.
  #
  # The default value for this integration is inferred from the hostname portion
  # of api_url.
  [instance: <string>]

  # Automatically collect metrics from this integration. If disabled,
  # the snmp integration will be run but not scraped and thus not
  # remote-written. Metrics for the integration will be exposed at
  # /integrations/snmp/metrics and can be scraped by an external
  # process.
  [scrape_integration: <boolean> | default = <integrations_config.scrape_integrations>]

  # How often should the metrics be collected? Defaults to
  # prometheus.global.scrape_interval.
  [scrape_interval: <duration> | default = <global_config.scrape_interval>]

  # The timeout before considering the scrape a failure. Defaults to
  # prometheus.global.scrape_timeout.
  [scrape_timeout: <duration> | default = <global_config.scrape_timeout>]

  # Allows for relabeling labels on the target.
  relabel_configs:
    [- <relabel_config> ... ]

  # Relabel metrics coming from the integration, allowing to drop series
  # from the integration that you don't care about.
  metric_relabel_configs:
    [ - <relabel_config> ... ]

  # How frequent to truncate the WAL for this integration.
  [wal_truncate_frequency: <duration> | default = "60m"]

  # Map of SNMP connection profiles that can be used to override default SNMP settings.

## snmp_target config

## walk_param config

```yaml
  # SNMP version to use. Defaults to 2.

    # Community string is used with SNMP v1 and v2. Defaults to "public".
    [community: <string> | default = "public"]

    # The equivalent options on NetSNMP commands like snmpbulkwalk
    # and snmpget are also listed. See snmpcmd(1).

    # Required if v3 is used, no default. -u option to NetSNMP.
    [username: <string> | default = "user"]

    # Can be noAuthNoPriv, authNoPriv or authPriv.
    [security_level: <string> | default = "noAuthNoPriv"]

    # DES, AES, AES192, or AES256. Defaults to DES. -x option to NetSNMP.

## About SNMP modules

SNMP module is the set of SNMP counters to be scraped together from the specific network device.

SNMP modules available can be found in the embedded snmp.yml file [here](https://github.com/grafana/agent/blob/main/pkg/integrations/snmp_exporter/common/snmp.yml). If not specified, `if_mib` module is used.

If you need to use custom SNMP modules, you can [generate](https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter#generating-configuration) your own snmp.yml file and specify it using `config_file` parameter.
