# traces_config

The `traces_config` block configures a set of Tempo instances, each of which
configures its own tracing pipeline. Having multiple configs allows you to
configure multiple distinct pipelines, each of which collects spans and sends
them to a different location.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
If you are using multiple configs, you must manually set port numbers for
each receiver, otherwise they will all try to use the same port and fail to
start.
