# redis_exporter_config

The `redis_exporter_config` block configures the `redis_exporter` integration, which is an embedded version of [`redis_exporter`](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter). This allows for the collection of metrics from Redis servers.

Note that currently, an Agent can only collect metrics from a single Redis server. If you want to collect metrics from multiple Redis servers, you can run multiple Agents and add labels using `relabel_configs` to differentiate between the Redis servers:

```yaml
redis_exporter:
  enabled: true
  redis_addr: "redis-2:6379"
  relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__address__]
    target_label: instance
    replacement: redis-2
```

We strongly recommend that you configure a separate user for the Agent, and give it only the strictly mandatory
security privileges necessary for monitoring your node, as per the [official documentation](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter#authenticating-with-redis).

Full reference of options:
```yaml

  # collect system metrics from the configured redis address
  [enabled: <boolean> | default = false]

  # Sets an explicit value for the instance label when the integration is
  # self-scraped. Overrides inferred values.
  #
  # The default value for this integration is inferred from the hostname
  # portion of redis_addr.
  [instance: <string>]

  # Automatically collect metrics from this integration. If disabled,
  # the redis_exporter integration will be run but not scraped and thus not
  # remote-written. Metrics for the integration will be exposed at
  # /integrations/redis_exporter/metrics and can be scraped by an external
  # process.

  # How often should the metrics be collected? Defaults to

  # prometheus.global.scrape_timeout.

  # Allows for relabeling labels on the target.
  relabel_configs:

  # from the integration that you don't care about.
