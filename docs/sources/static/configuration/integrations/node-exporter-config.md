# node_exporter_config

The `node_exporter_config` block configures the `node_exporter` integration,
which is an embedded version of
[`node_exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)
and allows for collecting metrics from the UNIX system that `node_exporter` is
running on. It provides a significant amount of collectors that are responsible
for monitoring various aspects of the host system.

Note that if running the Agent in a container, you will need to bind mount
folders from the host system so the integration can monitor them. You can use
the example below, making sure to replace `/path/to/config.yaml` with a path on
your host machine where an Agent configuration file is:

```
docker run \
  --net="host" \
  --pid="host" \
  --cap-add=SYS_TIME \
  -v "/:/host/root:ro,rslave" \
  -v "/sys:/host/sys:ro,rslave" \
  -v "/proc:/host/proc:ro,rslave" \
  -v /tmp/agent:/etc/agent \
  -v /path/to/config.yaml:/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml \
  grafana/agent:{{< param "AGENT_RELEASE" >}} \
  --config.file=/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml
```

Use this configuration file for testing out `node_exporter` support, replacing
the `remote_write` settings with settings appropriate for you:

```yaml
server:
  log_level: info

metrics:
  wal_directory: /tmp/agent
  global:
    scrape_interval: 60s
    remote_write:
    - url: https://prometheus-us-central1.grafana.net/api/prom/push
      basic_auth:
        username: user-id
        password: api-token

integrations:
  node_exporter:
    enabled: true
    rootfs_path: /host/root
    sysfs_path: /host/sys
    procfs_path: /host/proc
    udev_data_path: /host/root/run/udev/data
```

For running on Kubernetes, ensure to set the equivalent mounts and capabilities
there as well:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: agent
spec:
  containers:
  - image: {{< param "AGENT_RELEASE" >}}
    name: agent
    args:
    - --config.file=/etc/agent-config/agent.yaml
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["SYS_TIME"]
      privileged: true
      runAsUser: 0
    volumeMounts:
    - name: rootfs
      mountPath: /host/root
      readOnly: true
    - name: sysfs
      mountPath: /host/sys
      readOnly: true
    - name: procfs
      mountPath: /host/proc
      readOnly: true
  hostPID: true
  hostNetwork: true
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet
  volumes:
  - name: rootfs
    hostPath:
      path: /
  - name: sysfs
    hostPath:
      path: /sys
  - name: procfs
    hostPath:
      path: /proc
```

The manifest and Tanka configs provided by this repository do not have the
mounts or capabilities required for running this integration.

Some collectors only work on specific operating systems, documented in the
table below. Enabling a collector that is not supported by the operating system
the Agent is running on is a no-op.
