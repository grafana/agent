# mysqld_exporter_config

The `mysqld_exporter_config` block configures the `mysqld_exporter` integration,
which is an embedded version of
[`mysqld_exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter)
and allows for collection metrics from MySQL servers.

Note that currently, an Agent can only collect metrics from a single MySQL
server. If you want to collect metrics from multiple servers, run multiple
Agents and add labels using `relabel_configs` to differentiate between the MySQL
servers:

```yaml
mysqld_exporter:
  enabled: true
  data_source_name: root@(server-a:3306)/
  relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__address__]
    target_label: instance
    replacement: server-a
```

We strongly recommend that you configure a separate user for the Agent, and give it only the strictly mandatory
security privileges necessary for monitoring your node, as per the [official documentation](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter#required-grants).

Full reference of options:

```yaml
  # Enables the mysqld_exporter integration, allowing the Agent to collect
  # metrics from a MySQL server.
  [enabled: <boolean> | default = false]

  # Sets an explicit value for the instance label when the integration is
  # self-scraped. Overrides inferred values.
  #
  # The default value for this integration is a truncated version of the
  # connection DSN, containing only the server and db name. (Credentials
  # are not included.)
  [instance: <string>]

  # Automatically collect metrics from this integration. If disabled,
  # the mysqld_exporter integration will be run but not scraped and thus not
  # remote-written. Metrics for the integration will be exposed at
  # /integrations/mysqld_exporter/metrics and can be scraped by an external
  # process.
  [scrape_integration: <boolean> | default = <integrations_config.scrape_integrations>]

  # How often should the metrics be collected? Defaults to
  # prometheus.global.scrape_interval.
  [scrape_interval: <duration> | default = <global_config.scrape_interval>]

  # The timeout before considering the scrape a failure. Defaults to
  # prometheus.global.scrape_timeout.
  [scrape_timeout: <duration> | default = <global_config.scrape_timeout>]

  # Allows for relabeling labels on the target.
  relabel_configs:
    [- <relabel_config> ... ]

  # Relabel metrics coming from the integration, allowing to drop series
  # from the integration that you don't care about.
  metric_relabel_configs:
    [ - <relabel_config> ... ]

  # How frequent to truncate the WAL for this integration.
  [wal_truncate_frequency: <duration> | default = "60m"]

  # Data Source Name specifies the MySQL server to connect to. This is REQUIRED
  # but may also be specified by the MYSQLD_EXPORTER_DATA_SOURCE_NAME
  # environment variable. If neither are set, the integration will fail to
  # start.
  #
  # The format of this is specified here: https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name
  #
  # A working example value for a server with no required password
  # authentication is: "root@(localhost:3306)/"
  data_source_name: <string>

  enable_collectors:

  # A list of collector names to disable from the default set.
  disable_collectors:

  # A list of collectors to run. Fully overrides the default set.
  set_collectors:

  # Set a lock_wait_timeout on the connection to avoid long metadata locking.
  [lock_wait_timeout: <int> | default = 2]
  # Add a low_slow_filter to avoid slow query logging of scrapes. NOT supported
  # by Oracle MySQL.

  [perf_schema_eventsstatements_time_limit: <int> | default = 86400]
  # Maximum length of the normalized statement text.
  [perf_schema_eventsstatements_digtext_text_limit: <int> | default = 120]
  # Regex file_name filter for performance_schema.file_summary_by_instance
