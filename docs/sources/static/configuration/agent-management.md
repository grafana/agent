# Agent Management - Experimental

**Agent Management is under active development. Backwards incompatible changes to its API are to be expected. Feedback is much appreciated. This is a feature that MAY NOT make it production.**

Agent Management enables centralized management of fleets of Grafana Agents.

In this mode, Grafana Agent polls and dynamically reloads its configuration from a remote API server.

Remote Configurations are composed of a base configuration and a set of snippets. Snippets are applied conditionally via label matching.

## Configuration

Agent Management can be used by passing the flag `-enable-features=agent-management`. When enabled, the file referred to `-config.file` will be loaded as an agent management configuration file.

Agent Management configuration files are YAML documents which conform the following schema:

```yaml
# Agent Management configuration.
agent_management:
  # Host of the API server to connect to.
  host: <string>

  # Protocol to use when connecting to the API server (http|https).
  protocol: <string>

  # The polling interval for fetching the configuration.
  polling_interval: <string>

  # Sets the `Authorization` header on every request with the
  # configured username and password.
  basic_auth:
    [ username: <string> ]
    [ password_file: <string> ]

  # Optional proxy URL.
  [ proxy_url: <string> ]

  # Comma-separated string that can contain IPs, CIDR notation, domain names
  # that should be excluded from proxying. IP and domain names can
  # contain port numbers.
  [ no_proxy: <string> ]

  # Use proxy URL indicated by environment variables (HTTP_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTPs_PROXY, https_proxy, and no_proxy)
  [ proxy_from_environment: <boolean> | default: false ]

  # Specifies headers to send to proxies during CONNECT requests.
  [ proxy_connect_header:
    [ <string>: [<secret>, ...] ] ]

  # Fields specific to remote configuration.
  remote_configuration:
    # A path to a directory where the remote configuration will be cached. The directory must be writeable.
    cache_location: <string>

    # The namespace to use.
    namespace: <string>

    # Set of self-identifying labels used for snippet selection.
    labels:
      [ <labelname>: <labelvalue> ... ]

    # Whether to use labels from the label management service. If enabled, labels from the API supersede the ones configured in the agent.
    label_management_enabled: <bool> | default = false

    # Whether to accept HTTP 304 Not Modified responses from the API server. If enabled, the agent will use the cached configuration if the API server responds with HTTP 304 Not Modified. You can set this argument to `false` for debugging or testing.
    accept_http_not_modified: <bool> | default = true

    # A unique ID for the agent, which is used to identify the agent.
    agent_id: <string>
```

## API (v2)

Grafana Agents with Agent Management enabled continuously poll the API server for an up-to-date configuration. The API server is expected to implement a `GET /agent-management/api/agent/v2/namespace/:namespace/remote_config` HTTP endpoint returning a successful response with the following body format:

```yaml
# The base configuration for the Agent.
base_config: |
  <grafana_agent_config>
# A set of snippets to be conditionally merged into the base configuration.
snippets:
  [ <snippet_name>: <snippet_content> ... ]
```

### grafana_agent_config

This is a standard Grafana Agent [static mode configuration](/docs/agent/latest/static/configuration/). Typically used to configure the server, remote_writes, and other global configuration.

### snippet_content

The snippet content is a YAML document which conforms to the following schema:

```yaml
# Config provides the actual snippet configuration.
config: |
  [metrics_scrape_configs]:
  - [<scrape_config> ... ]
  [logs_scrape_configs]:
  - [<promtail.scrape_config> ... ]
  [integration_configs]:
    [<integrations_config> ... ]
# Selector is a set of labels used to decide which snippets to apply to the final configuration.
selector:
  [ <labelname>: <labelvalue> ... ]
```

> **Note:** More information on the following types can be found in their respective documentation pages:
>
> * [`scrape_config`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/2.45/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config)
> * [`promtail.scrape_config`](/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/configuration/#scrape_configs)
> * [`integrations_config`](/docs/agent/latest/static/configuration/integrations)

> **Note:** Snippet selection is currently done in the API server. This behaviour is subject to change in the future.
