## Install static mode on other systems

Install Grafana Agent and get it up and running using a binary file.

### Overview
Binary executables are provided for the most common operating systems. Choose the binary from the Assets list on the Releases page that matches your operating system.

ppc64le builds are currently considered secondary release targets and do not have the same level of support and testing as other platforms.

### Steps

1. Navigate to [Releases](https://github.com/grafana/agent/releases).

   This page includes instructions for downloading static binaries that are published with every release. These releases contain binary executables for Windows, Linux and macOS.

1. Scroll down to the **Assets** section.
1. Download the version that matches your operating system.
1. Extract the package contents into a directory.
1. Enter `chmod +x “file name”` in your command line to check that it is executable.
