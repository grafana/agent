# Grafana Cloud Agent

Grafana Cloud Agent is an observability data collector optimized for sending
metrics and log data to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/).
Today, with its Prometheus metrics collection, it is designed to handle the
main problems users of large deployments of Prometheus face:

- Grafana Cloud Agent uses less memory on average than Prometheus by doing less
  (only focusing on `remote_write`-related functionality).
- Grafana Cloud Agent allows for deloying multiple instances of the Agent in a
  cluster and only scraping metrics from targets that the host the agent is
  running on. This allows distributing memory requirements across the cluster
  rather than on a single node.
