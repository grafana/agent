# Grafana Agent Documentation

This directory contains documentation for Grafana Agent. It is split into two
parts:

* `user/`: Documentation for users. This directory is hosted on
  [grafana.com/docs/agent](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/) and we
  recommend interacting with it there instead of viewing the markdown on
  Github.
* `developer/`: Documentation for contributors and maintainers.
* `rfcs/`: RFCs for proposals relating to Grafana Agent.

## Preview the website

Run `make docs`. This launches a preview of the website with the current grafana docs at `http://localhost:3002/docs/agent/latest/` which will refresh automatically when changes are made to content in the `sources` directory.
Make sure Docker is running.
