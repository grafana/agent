# Grafana Cloud Agent

The Grafana Cloud Agent is an observability data collector optimized for sending
metrics and log data to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/).
Today, with its Prometheus metrics collection, it is designed to handle the
main problems faced by users of large deployments of Prometheus:

- Grafana Cloud Agent uses less memory on average than Prometheus â€“ by doing less
  (only focusing on `remote_write`-related functionality).
- Grafana Cloud Agent allows for deploying multiple instances of the Agent in a
  cluster and only scraping metrics from targets that running at the same host.
  This allows distributing memory requirements across the cluster
  rather than pressurizing a single node.
