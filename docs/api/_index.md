# Grafana Agent APIs

The API is divided into several parts:

- [Config Management API](#config-management-api)  
- [Agent API](#agent-api)
- [Ready/Healthy API](#ready--health-api)

## Config management API

Grafana Agent exposes a config management REST API for managing instance configurations when it is running in [scraping service mode]({{< relref "../scraping-service" >}}). 

(Note that scraping service mode is a requirement for the config management API, however this is not a pre-req for the Agent API or Ready/Healthy API) 

The following endpoints are exposed:

- List configs: [`GET /agent/api/v1/configs`](#list-configs)
- Get config: [`GET /agent/api/v1/configs/{name}`](#get-config)
- Update config: [`PUT /agent/api/v1/config/{name}`](#update-config)
- Delete config: [`DELETE /agent/api/v1/config/{name}`](#delete-config)

### API response

All Config Management API endpoints will return responses in the following
form, unless an internal service error prevents the server from responding
properly:

```json
{
  "status": "success" | "error",
  "data": {}
}
```

Status will be either `success` or `error`. All 2xx responses will be
accompanied with a `success` value for the status field. 4xx and 5xx
responses will provide a value of `error`. All requests may potentially
return 500 on an internal error. Other non-500 responses will be documented
per API.

The data field may or may not be present, depending on the endpoint. It
provides extra information for the query. The documentation for each endpoint
will describe the full response provided.

### List configs

```
GET /agent/api/v1/configs
```

List configs returns a list of the named configurations currently known by the
underlying KV store.

Status code: 200 on success.
Response:

```
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "configs": [
      // list of config names:
      "a",
      "b",
      "c",
      // ...
    ]
  }
}
```

### Get config

```
GET /agent/api/v1/configs/{name}
```

Get config returns a single configuration by name. The configuration must
exist or an error will be returned. URL-encoded names will be retrieved in decoded
form. e.g., `hello%2Fworld` will represent the config named `hello/world`.

Status code: 200 on success, 400 on invalid config name.
Response on success:

```
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "value": "/* YAML configuration */"
  }
}
```

### Update config

```
PUT /agent/api/v1/config/{name}
POST /agent/api/v1/config/{name}
```

Update config updates or adds a new configuration by name. If a configuration
with the same name already exists, then it will be completely overwritten.

URL-encoded names are stored in decoded form. e.g., `hello%2Fworld` will
represent the config named `hello/world`.

The request body passed to this endpoint must match the format of
[metrics_instance_config]({{< relref "../configuration/metrics-config" >}})
defined in the Configuration Reference. The name field of the configuration is
ignored and the name in the URL takes precedence. The request body must be
formatted as YAML.

**WARNING**: By default, all instance configuration files that read
credentials from a file on disk will be rejected. This prevents malicious users
from reading the contents of arbitrary files as passwords and sending their
contents to fake remote_write endpoints. To change the behavior, set
`dangerous_allow_reading_files` to true in the `scraping_service` block.

Status code: 201 with a new config, 200 on updated config.
Response on success:

```
{
  "status": "success"
}
```

### Delete config

```
DELETE /agent/api/v1/config/{name}
```

Delete config attempts to delete a configuration by name. The named
configuration must exist; deleting a nonexistent config will result in an
error.

URL-encoded names will be interpreted in decoded form. e.g., `hello%2Fworld`
will represent the config named `hello/world`.

Status code: 200 on success, 400 with invalid config name.
Response on success:

```
{
  "status": "success"
}
```

## Agent API

### List current running instances

```
GET /agent/api/v1/instances
```

Status code: 200 on success.
Response on success:

```
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    <strings of instance names that are currently running>
  ]
}
```

### List current scrape targets

```
GET /agent/api/v1/targets
```

This endpoint collects all targets known to the Agent across all running
instances. Only targets being scraped from the local Agent will be returned. If
running in scraping service mode, this endpoint must be invoked in all Agents
separately to get the combined set of targets across the whole Agent cluster.

The `labels` fields shows the labels that will be added to metrics from the
target, while the `discovered_labels` field shows all labels found during
service discovery.

Status code: 200 on success.
Response on success:

```
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "instance": <string, instance config name>,
      "target_group": <string, scrape config group name>,
      "endpoint": <string, URL being scraped>
      "state": <string, one of up, down, unknown>,
      "discovered_labels": {
        "__address__": "<address>",
        ...
      },
      "labels": {
        "label_a": "value_a",
        ...
      },
      "last_scrape": <string, RFC 3339 timestamp of last scrape>,
      "scrape_duration_ms": <number, last scrape duration in milliseconds>,
      "scrape_error": <string, last error. empty if scrape succeeded>
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Reload configuration file (beta)

This endpoint is currently in beta and may have issues. Please open any issues
you encounter.

```
GET /-/reload
POST /-/reload
```

This endpoint will re-read the configuration file from disk and refresh the
entire state of the Agent to reflect the new file on disk:

- HTTP Server
- Prometheus metrics subsystem
- Loki logs subsystem
- Tempo traces subsystem
- Integrations

Valid configurations will be applied to each of the subsystems listed above, and
`/-/reload` will return with a status code of 200 once all subsystems have been
updated. Malformed configuration files (invalid YAML, failed validation checks)
will be immediately rejected with a status code of 400.

If the configuration for the HTTP server is changed, it will be restarted.
Because of this, it is not recommended to call `/-/reload` against the main HTTP
server, as restarting it will prevent an HTTP client from reading the response
of the reload. Instead, use the `--reload-addr` and `--reload-port` flags
supported by the Agent. That will launch a secondary HTTP server that only
responds to `/-/reload` and can be used to safely reload the system. This HTTP
server does not respect any options in the `config` struct, and is currently
TTP-only (no TLS support).

Well-formed configuration files can still be invalid for various reasons, such
as not having permissions to read the WAL directory. Issues such as these will
cause per-subsystem problems while reloading the configuration, and will leave
that subsystem in an undefined state. Specific errors encountered during reload
will be logged, and should be fixed before calling `/-/reload` again.

Status code: 200 on success, 400 otherwise.

### Show configuration file

```
GET /-/config
```

This endpoint prints out the currently loaded configuration the Agent is using.
The returned YAML has defaults applied, and only shows changes to the state that
validated successfuly, so the results will not identically match the
configuration file on disk.

Status code: 200 on success.

## Ready / health API

### Readiness check

```
GET /-/ready
```

Status code: 200 if ready.

Response:
```
Agent is Ready.
```

### Healthiness check

```
GET /-/healthy
```

Status code: 200 if healthy.

Response:
```
Agent is Healthy.
```
