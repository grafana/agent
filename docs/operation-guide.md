# Operation Guide

## Host Filtering 

Host Filtering implements a form of "dumb sharding," where operators may deploy
one Grafana Cloud Agent instance per machine in a cluster, all using the same
configuration, and the Grafana Cloud Agents will only scrape targets that are
running on the same node as the Agent. 

Running with `host_filter: true` means that if you have a target whose host
machine is not also running a Grafana Cloud Agent process, _that target will not
be scraped!_

Host Filtering is usually paired with a dedicated Agent process that is used for
scraping targets that are running outside of a given cluster. For example, when
running the Grafana Cloud Agent on GKE, you would have a DaemonSet with
`host_filter` for scraping in-cluster targets, and a single dedicated Deployment
for scraping other targets that are not running on a cluster node, such as the
Kubernetes control plane API.

If you want to scale your scrape load without host filtering, you may use the
[scraping service](./scraping-service.md) instead.

The host name of the Agent is determined by reading `$HOSTNAME`. If `$HOSTNAME`
isn't defined, the Agent will use Go's [os.Hostname](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#Hostname)
to determine the hostname.

The following meta-labels are used to determine if a target is running on the
same machine as the the target:

- `__address__`
- `__meta_consul_node`
- `__meta_dockerswarm_node_id`
- `__meta_dockerswarm_node_hostname`
- `__meta_dockerswarm_node_address`
- `__meta_kubernetes_pod_node_name`
- `__meta_kubernetes_node_name`
- `__host__`

The final label, `__host__`, isn't a label added by any Prometheus service
discovery mechanism. Rather, `__host__` can be generated by using
`host_filter_relabel_configs`. This allows for custom relabeling
rules to determine the hostname where the predefined ones fail. Relabeling rules
added with `host_filter_relabel_configs` are temporary and just used for the
host_filtering mechanism. Full relabeling rules should be applied in the
appropriate `scrape_config` instead.

Note that scrape_config `relabel_configs` do not apply to the host filtering
logic; only `host_filter_relabel_configs` will work.

If the determined hostname matches any of the meta labels, the discovered target
is allowed. Otherwise, the target is ignored, and will not show up in the
[targets
API](https://github.com/grafana/agent/blob/master/docs/api.md#list-current-scrape-targets).

## Prometheus "Instances"

The Grafana Cloud Agent defines a concept of a Prometheus _Instance_, which is
its own mini Prometheus-lite server. The Instance runs a combination of
Prometheus service discovery, scraping, a WAL for storage, and `remote_write`.

Instances allow for fine grained control of what data gets scraped and where it
gets sent. Users can easily define two Instances that scrape different subsets
of metrics and send them two two completely different remote_write systems.

Instances are especially relevant to the [scraping service
mode](./scraping-service.md), where breaking up your scrape configs into
multiple Instances is required for sharding and balancing scrape load across a
cluster of Agents.

## Instance Sharing

The v0.5.0 release of the Agent introduced the concept of _Instance sharing_,
which combines scrape_configs from compatible Instance configs into a single,
shared Instance. Instance configs are compatible when they have no differences
in configuration with the exception of what they scrape. `remote_write` configs
may also differ in the order which endpoints are declared, but the unsorted
`remote_writes` must still be an exact match.

In the shared Instances mode, the `name` field of `remote_write` configs is
ignored. The resulting `remote_write` configs will have a name identical to the
first six characters of the group name and the first six characters of the hash
from that `remote_write` config separated by a `-`.

The shared Instances mode is the new default, and the previous behavior is
deprecated. If you wish to restore the old behavior, set `instance_mode:
distinct` in the
[`prometheus_config`](./configuration-reference.md#prometheus_config) block of
your config file.

Shared Instances are completely transparent to the user with the exception of
exposed metrics. With `instance_mode: shared`, metrics for Prometheus components
(WAL, service discovery, remote_write, etc) have a `instance_group_name` label,
which is the hash of all settings used to determine the shared instance. When
`instance_mode: distinct` is set, the metrics for Prometheus components will
instead have an `instance_name` label, which matches the name set on the
individual Instance config. It is recommended to use the default of
`instance_mode: shared` unless you don't mind the performance hit and really
need granular metrics.

Users can use the [targets API](./api.md#list-current-scrape-targets) to see all
scraped targets, and the name of the shared instance they were assigned to.
