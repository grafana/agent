# Grafana Agent Helm chart

{{ template "chart.typeBadge" . }}{{ template "chart.versionBadge" . }}{{ template "chart.appVersionBadge" . }}

Helm chart for deploying [Grafana Agent][] to Kubernetes.

[Grafana Agent]: https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/

## Usage

This chart installs one instance of Grafana Agent into your Kubernetes cluster
using a specific Kubernetes controller. By default, DaemonSet is used. The
`controller.type` value can be used to change the controller to either a
StatefulSet or Deployment.

Creating multiple installations of the Helm chart with different controllers is
useful if just using the default DaemonSet isn't sufficient.

## Flow mode is the default

By default, [Grafana Agent Flow][Flow] is deployed. To opt out of Flow mode and
use the older mode (called "static mode"), set the `agent.mode` value to
`static`.

[Flow]: https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/

### agent.extraArgs

`agent.extraArgs` allows for passing extra arguments to the Grafana Agent
container. The list of available arguments is documented on [agent run][].

> **WARNING**: Using `agent.extraArgs` does not have a stable API. Things may
> break between Chart upgrade if an argument gets added to the template.

[agent run]: https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/reference/cli/run/

### agent.extraPorts

`agent.extraPorts` allows for configuring specific open ports.

The detained specification of ports can be found at the [Kubernetes Pod documents](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#ports).

Port numbers specified must be 0 < x < 65535.

| ChartPort | KubePort | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| targetPort | containerPort | Number of port to expose on the pod's IP address. |
| hostPort | hostPort | (Optional) Number of port to expose on the host. Daemonsets taking traffic might find this useful. |
| name | name | If specified, this must be an `IANA_SVC_NAME` and unique within the pod. Each named port in a pod must have a unique name. Name for the port that can be referred to by services.
| protocol | protocol | Must be UDP, TCP, or SCTP. Defaults to "TCP". |

### agent.listenAddr

`agent.listenAddr` allows for restricting which address the agent listens on
for network traffic on its HTTP server. By default, this is `0.0.0.0` to allow
its UI to be exposed when port-forwarding and to expose its metrics to other
agents in the cluster.

### agent.configMap.config

`agent.configMap.content` holds the Grafana Agent configuration to use.

If `agent.configMap.content` is not provided, a [default configuration file][default-config] is
used. When provided, `agent.configMap.content` must hold a valid River configuration file.

[default-config]: ./config/example.river

### controller.securityContext

`controller.securityContext` sets the securityContext passed to the Grafana
Agent container.

By default, Grafana Agent containers are not able to collect telemetry from the
host node or other specific types of privileged telemetry data. See [Collecting
logs from other containers][#collecting-logs-from-other-containers] and
[Collecting host node telemetry][#collecting-host-node-telemetry] below for
more information on how to enable these capabilities.

### rbac.create

`rbac.create` enables the creation of ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBindings for
the Grafana Agent containers to use. The default permission set allows Flow
components like [discovery.kubernetes][] to work properly.

## Collecting logs from other containers

There are two ways to collect logs from other containers within the cluster
the agent is deployed in.

### Versions >= 0.31.x

The [loki.source.kubernetes][] component introduced in 0.31.0 may be used to
collect logs as an alternative to tailing files from the host. This component
does not require mounting the hosts filesystem into the Agent, nor requires
additional security contexts to work correctly.

However, `loki.source.kubernetes` is experimental and may have issues not
present in the file-based approach.

[loki.source.kubernetes]: https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/reference/components/loki.source.kubernetes/

### Versions < 0.31.x

For those running the Agent on versions prior to 0.31.0, the only way to collect logs
from other containers is to mount `/var/lib/docker/containers` from the host and read
the log files directly.

This capability is disabled by default.

To expose logs from other containers to Grafana Agent:

* Set `agent.mounts.dockercontainers` to `true`.
* Set `controller.securityContext` to:
  ```yaml
  privileged: true
  runAsUser: 0
  ```

## Collecting host node telemetry

Telemetry from the host, such as host-specific log files (from `/var/logs`) or
metrics from `/proc` and `/sys` are not accessible to Grafana Agent containers.

To expose this information to Grafana Agent for telemetry collection:

* Set `agent.mounts.dockercontainers` to `true`.
* Mount `/proc` and `/sys` from the host into the container.
* Set `controller.securityContext` to:
  ```yaml
  privileged: true
  runAsUser: 0
  ```
