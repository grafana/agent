Grafana Agent is a vendor-neutral, batteries-included telemetry collector with
configuration inspired by [Terraform][]. It is designed to be flexible,
performant, and compatible with multiple ecosystems such as Prometheus and
OpenTelemetry.

Grafana Agent is based around **components**. Components are wired together to
form programmable observability **pipelines** for telemetry collection,
processing, and delivery.

> **NOTE**: This page focuses mainly on "[Flow mode][Grafana Agent Flow]," the
> Terraform-inspired revision of Grafana Agent.

Grafana Agent can collect, transform, and send data to:

* The [Prometheus][] ecosystem
* The [OpenTelemetry][] ecosystem
* The Grafana open source ecosystem ([Loki][], [Grafana][], [Tempo][], [Mimir][], [Pyroscope][])

## Why use Grafana Agent?

* **Vendor-neutral**: Fully compatible with the Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and
  Grafana open source ecosystems.
* **Every signal**: Collect telemetry data for metrics, logs, traces, and
  continuous profiles.
* **Scalable**: Deploy on any number of machines to collect millions of active
  series and terabytes of logs.
* **Battle-tested**: Grafana Agent extends the existing battle-tested code from
  the Prometheus and OpenTelemetry Collector projects.
* **Powerful**: Write programmable pipelines with ease, and debug them using a
  [built-in UI][UI].
* **Batteries included**: Integrate with systems like MySQL, Kubernetes, and
  Apache to get telemetry that's immediately useful.

## Example

```river
// Discover Kubernetes pods to collect metrics from.
discovery.kubernetes "pods" {
  role = "pod"
}

// Collect metrics from Kubernetes pods.
prometheus.scrape "default" {
  targets    = discovery.kubernetes.pods.targets
  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.default.receiver]
}

// Get an API key from disk.
local.file "apikey" {
  filename  = "/var/data/my-api-key.txt"
  is_secret = true
}

// Send metrics to a Prometheus remote_write endpoint.
prometheus.remote_write "default" {
  endpoint {
    url = "http://localhost:9009/api/prom/push"

    basic_auth {
      username = "MY_USERNAME"
      password = local.file.apikey.content
    }
  }
}
```

We maintain an example [Docker Compose environment][] that can be used to
launch dependencies to play with Grafana Agent locally.

## Release cadence

A new minor release is planned every six weeks. You can use the list of
[Milestones][] to see what maintainers are planning on working on for a given
release cycle.

Both the release cadence and the items assigned to a milestone are best-effort:
releases may be moved forwards or backwards if needed, and items may be moved
to a different milestone or removed entirely. The planned release dates for
future minor releases do not change if one minor release is moved.

Patch and security releases may be created at any time.
